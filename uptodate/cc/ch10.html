Source: Save the Redwoods League and Humboldt State University. Excerpt: Newly published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112719319449">research</a> from Save the Redwoods League and Humboldt State University (HSU) confirms the exceptionally large role that redwood forests can play in California’s strategy to address climate change. The research demonstrates that old-growth coast redwood forests store more carbon per acre than any other forest type. ...The findings cap 11 years of research through the League’s <a href="https://www.savetheredwoods.org/what-we-do/our-work/study/understanding-climate-change/">Redwoods and Climate Change Initiative</a> (RCCI), which <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112718315160?via%3Dihub">has also revealed</a> that younger second-growth coast redwood forests grow quickly enough to result in substantial carbon storage in a relatively short period. This makes a strong case for investing in the restoration of previously logged redwood forests. ...Prior to industrial logging, California had more than 2 million acres of ancient redwoods, but now only about 113,000 acres of old-growth redwood forests remain, largely protected in parks and preserves. According to Sillett’s team, there can be up to 890 metric tons of carbon (1 metric ton = 2,205 pounds) stored per acre of old-growth redwood forest, which is the estimated equivalent of taking about 700 passenger vehicles off the road for a year. In place of all that lost old-growth forest now stand about 1.5 million acres of younger second-growth redwood forests. ...While these regrowing forests don’t match old-growth forests in terms of total biomass or carbon storage per acre, they grow extremely quickly and recover fire- and decay-resistant carbon storage capacity fast. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112718315160">In a study published last year</a>, the RCCI team found that in 150 years, fast-growing second-growth redwood forests can accumulate 40 percent as much biomass and store 30 percent as much carbon as the original old-growth in their decay-resistant heartwood. Further, some redwood forests that were logged in the mid-1800s have already accumulated as much as 339 metric tons of carbon per acre—the equivalent of taking about 270 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. This level of carbon storage has profound implications when extended across 1.5 million acres of second-growth redwood forests.... </p><p>2021-04-22. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/climate/wood-pellet-industry-climate.html">There’s a Booming Business in America’s Forests.

In barely a decade, the Southeast’s wood pellet industry has grown from almost nothing to 23 mills with capacity to produce more than 10 million metric tons annually for export. It employs more than 1,000 people directly, and has boosted local logging and trucking businesses. ...The open question is whether a world increasingly desperate to avert climate disaster will continue to embrace, or turn away from, humanity’s original fuel: wood. Most divisive is the industry’s claim to battle climate change by replacing dirty fossil fuels with clean bioenergy. ...Many foresters, economists and environmental policy experts endorse that idea. But a legion of ecologists, conservationists and others strongly disagree. ...In 2009, European officials decided to declare biomass energy — basically, the burning of wood or other plants, rather than fossil fuels — to be carbon neutral. The idea is that regrowing plants, over time, would ultimately reabsorb the carbon dioxide released by the burning. ...Many scientists have long been skeptical of biomass’s climate benefits. Wood releases more carbon dioxide per unit of electricity produced than coal or gas, and a newly planted tree can take decades to reabsorb the carbon dioxide emitted by burning. ...In 2009, a group ...wrote in the journal Science protesting what they called a “critical climate accounting error.” They argued that certain major international climate policies and legislation designed to reduce countries’ greenhouse gas emissions allow nations to burn biomass and discount their smokestack emissions but fail to account for the carbon losses caused by cutting down trees to burn them....

But as research has increasingly revealed how climate change will forever alter the ecosystems and communities she loves, she has struggled to address her feelings of sadness. “My dispassionate training,” the Lund University researcher writes, has “not prepared me for the increasingly frequent emotional crises of climate change,” or how to respond to students who come to her to share their own grief. It’s a situation many scientists and professors are facing these days, Nicholas writes. “Being witness to the demise or death of what we love has started to look an awful lot like the job description.” But Nicholas says the untimely death of a close friend helped persuade her that the only way forward was to acknowledge that “we are not going to be able to save all the things we love.” Instead, she says, we have to “swim through that ocean of grief … and recognize that we still have time to act, and salvage many of the things we care about.” ...In 2017, she and climate scientist Seth Wynes, now at Concordia University, published <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541">a high-profile paper</a> showing the most effective actions to reduce an individual’s carbon footprint—such as flying less or shifting to a vegetarian diet—are rarely emphasized by governments or educators.

One is the biogenic cycle, in which carbon circulates between the atmosphere, land, and oceans. The other is the slower, nonbiogenic cycle in which carbon circulates between fossil fuels stored underground and the atmosphere. The biogenic cycle can occur within hours, days, and years. The nonbiogenic cycle takes hundreds of thousands, even millions, of years. Net zero targets conflate the two cycles, the FoEI report claims. Targets assume all the carbon that’s already circulating in the atmosphere as well as all the carbon that will be emitted by fossil fuels can be safely and effectively sequestered. ...We are putting significant stress on all these pools by pushing them to take up additional fossil CO2.…We cannot just stuff the geosphere (i.e., CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels) into the biosphere,” the report says....

The need to study the real-world effects of releasing reflective particles is pressing, says David Keith, a Harvard energy and climate scientist and one of SCoPEx’s lead scientists. Solar geoengineering is no substitute for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, he says, but it could ameliorate the worst damage of global warming, such as the extreme heat waves and storms that claim many lives today. ...But research in solar geoengineering has long been taboo, says Faye McNeill, an atmospheric chemist at Columbia University who is unaffiliated with SCoPEx. “We didn’t want it to appear that we were encouraging it.” One fear is that solar geoengineering could be done unilaterally by groups or nations, with unknown effects on plant growth and rainfall patterns. Another worry is that it would encourage a sort of addiction, adding more and more particles to block warming while not addressing the root problem of mounting emissions. But now, with so much warming already locked in, “the urgency of the climate problem has escalated,” McNeill says....

Excerpt: The world’s wealthy will need to reduce their carbon footprints by a factor of 30 to help put the planet on a path to curb the ever-worsening impacts of climate change, according to new findings published Wednesday by the United Nations Environment Program. Currently, the emissions attributable to the richest 1 percent of the global population account for more than double those of the poorest 50 percent. Shifting that balance, researchers found, will require swift and substantial lifestyle changes, including decreases in air travel, a rapid embrace of renewable energy and electric vehicles, and better public planning to encourage walking, bicycle riding and public transit. But individual choices are hardly the only key to mitigating the intensifying consequences of climate change. Wednesday’s annual “emissions gap” report, which assesses the difference between the world’s current path and measures needed to manage climate change, details how the world remains woefully off target in its quest to slow the Earth’s warming. The drop in greenhouse gas emissions during this year’s pandemic, while notable, will have almost no impact on slowing the warming that lies ahead unless humankind drastically alters its policies and behavior, the report finds....

That’s a stunning drop when most existing solutions cut methane by about 20 or 30 percent. ...growing seaweed used for the feed supplement could also help sequester carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas, and reduce ocean acidification, because the plant sucks up carbon in the water as food....

And in Alaska,<a href="https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/alaskan-tribes-join-together-assess-harmful-algal-blooms"> a partnership of 11 tribes</a> has formed to identify harmful algae blooms so that it’s clear when shellfish can be safely harvested.

The institute has consulted with more than 300 of the 574 tribes in the United States, Cooley said. It’s natural that Indigenous people who have lived with the land for generations, attuned to the cycles of nature, would be leaders in adapting to climate change and marrying that to culture and health. “We’ve always been taught and are still being told we have to preserve for the future generations,” she added....

The term community-led relocation, for example, includes consideration of the complex tapestry of people who leave a place they have inhabited to settle in another, as well as the fact that these community tapestries are bound not by geography but by relationships and practice. “Community led” also highlights the <a href="https://theconversation.com/climigration-when-communities-must-move-because-of-climate-change-122529">importance of community engagement</a>, input, and leadership in decision-making, visioning, planning, and implementation [Marino et al., 2019]....

Excerpt: ...Even if energy, transportation, and manufacturing go entirely green, emissions of greenhouse gases from the food system would put the world on track to warm by more than 1.5°C, a target set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. For the world to have a chance of preventing significant harm from climate change, the study authors say, all parts of food production need rapid and significant reform—everything from reducing deforestation for new fields to eating less meat. ...Carbon dioxide comes from many sources, such as cutting down tropical forests to make way for fields and pastures, running farm machinery, and manufacture of agrochemicals. Fertilizer also emits nitrous oxide, another greenhouse gas. And cows release methane, a powerful warming gas, in their burps and manure. ...The team assumed no radical changes in how food is produced, but continuing increases in efficiency. ...As incomes rise, people tend to eat more overall and consume more meat, dairy, and eggs—and animal products have a larger climate footprint than plant-based foods. The researchers then performed a thought experiment in which all other sources of greenhouse gases were immediately halted. Think: a complete transition to electric vehicles, geothermally heated buildings, renewable power, and so on. Given that climate utopia, but no change in how food is produced, the situation is still “very frightening,” Clark says.

By Saqib Rahim, The Washington Post. Excerpt: Rob Weary ...as a dealmaker trying to convince small countries to protect their seas in a novel way — in partnership with big banks and international financial institutions. Four years ago, he struck a pioneering deal with the Seychelles, a splash of islands off the East African coast. ...the country was deep in debt.... Its economy depended on tourism and fishing, two industries facing decimation from climate change. As part of an investment team at the Nature Conservancy, the U.S.-based environmental group, Weary threw the Seychelles a lifeline: a chance to refinance more than $21 million of its debt. There were just two conditions. The government had to spend the savings on ocean conservation work such as coral restoration and trash cleanup, and it had to designate 30 percent of its waters as special zones where activities such as fishing and drilling are highly regulated or off limits. The nation’s leaders delivered. The Seychelles hasn’t missed a payment, and this spring <a href="http://www.statehouse.gov.sc/news/4787/seychelles-designates-30-of-its-eez-as-marine-protected-area">its president announced</a> it had met that target, protecting an area larger than Germany. Now some of the giants of the financial world are realizing there could be profits in ocean conservation. “Basically what we’re doing is financial engineering,” Weary said recently. “That’s typically used by hedge funds and private equity funds, with their goal of course to make returns for their investors.” It’s just that the investment objective here is different. “We’re doing all these to help Mother Nature.”....

Excerpt: Protecting intact peatlands and restoring degraded ones are crucial steps if the world is to counter climate change, European researchers said Friday. ... without protection and restoration efforts [for peat bogs], some targets for greenhouse gas emissions “would be very difficult or nearly impossible to achieve,” said Alexander Popp, an author of the study, which was published in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1748-9326">Environmental Research Letters</a>. ...Peatlands ...make up only about 3 percent of global land area, but their deep layers of peat are practically treasure chests of carbon, overall containing roughly twice as much as the world’s forests. In pristine bogs, that carbon remains soggy and intact. But when a bog is dried out, for agriculture or other reasons, the carbon starts to oxidize and is released to the atmosphere as planet-warming carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. ...Current estimates are that drained peatlands worldwide emit as much carbon dioxide annually as global air travel. But dry peat is also a fire risk, and peat fires have the potential to release a lot of carbon very quickly. In September and October 2015, peat fires in Indonesia, where bogs have long been drained for palm oil plantations and other purposes, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep26886">released more carbon dioxide per day</a> than all the fossil fuels burned in the European Union. Dried peatlands could be restored by allowing them to become wet again, which would saturate the decaying vegetation and prevent further release of carbon dioxide, and also eliminate the fire hazard....

However, cities cannot achieve sustainability without a holistic view of the interdependencies among essential human needs (food, energy, and water); constructed urban infrastructure; associated natural systems (air, water, land, ecosystems); and social, political, and legal decisions spanning all relevant scales (individuals, neighborhoods, municipalities, regions, nations). For example, national policy can limit or enhance what is doable within a city. At the local scale, residents of a single neighborhood can delay projects by tying them up in litigation.

One, on the carbon costs of meetings, emerged directly from the 2019 European Astronomical Society (EAS) meeting in France, which took place during a record-breaking heatwave when temperatures exceeded 45°C. “We were sitting with no air conditioning, sweating through all these interesting talks,” Burtscher says. Discussions turned to climate change and the carbon emitted getting everyone to the meeting, and they inspired Burtscher and his colleagues to size up the meeting’s travel emissions. They added up to nearly 1900 tons of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) equivalent or about 1.5 tons per delegate—roughly the same as emitted by an average resident of India in a whole year. ...Another of the six studies found that Australian astronomers each produced 37 tons of CO<span style="font-size:13.333333015441895px">2</span> equivalent per year, of which 60% came from supercomputer usage. ...“There’s a lot of excitement about the potential” of virtual meetings, says Travis Rector of the University of Alaska, Anchorage, who heads the sustainability committee of the American Astronomical Society (AAS). When this year’s EAS meeting went virtual because of COVID-19, the team that calculated the carbon costs of the 2019 meeting did a new analysis.

Such cinematic juxtapositions are persuasive: A dying planet is an ugly one, while healthy ecosystems please the eye and the earth. ...The most devastating sequence finds Attenborough charting the disasters we face in future decades — global crises that he, as a man now in his 90s, will not experience.

Gahcho Kué... is an expansive open pit mine.... ...Dipple and two students...were looking to use the mine’s crushed rock waste as a vault to lock up carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) for eternity. At Gahcho Kué, Dipple’s team bubbled a mix of CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen gas simulating diesel exhaust through a grayish green slurry of crushed mine waste in water. Over 2 days, the slurry acquired a slight rusty hue—evidence that its iron was oxidizing while its magnesium and calcium were sucking up CO<sub>2</sub> and turning it into to carbon-based minerals. ... a wide array of rock and mudlike wastes from mining, cement and aluminum production, coal burning, and other large-scale industrial processes share a similar affinity for the greenhouse gas. Known as alkaline solid wastes, these materials have a high pH, which causes them to react with CO<sub>2</sub>  a mild acid. And unlike other schemes for drawing excess CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, these reactive rocks can both capture the gas and store it, locked away permanently in a solid mineral. ...But there are major hurdles. Governments will need to offer incentives for mineralization on the massive scale needed to make a dent in atmospheric carbon.

Australia shattered its summer heat records as wildfires, fueled by prolonged drought, turned the sky fever red. For 150 years of industrialization, the combustion of coal, oil and gas has steadily released heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, driving up average global temperatures and setting heat records. Nearly everywhere around the world, heat waves are more frequent and longer lasting than they were 70 years ago. But a hotter planet does not hurt equally. If you’re poor and marginalized, you’re likely to be much more vulnerable to extreme heat. You might be unable to afford an air-conditioner, and you might not even have electricity when you need it. You may have no choice but to work outdoors under a sun so blistering that first your knees feel weak and then delirium sets in. Or the heat might bring a drought so punishing that, no matter how hard you work under the sun, your corn withers and your children turn to you in hunger. ...Extreme heat is not a future risk. It’s now. It endangers human health, food production and the fate of entire economies. And it’s worst for those at the bottom of the economic ladder in their societies....

Excerpt: ...summer in Phoenix, where a cocktail of climate change and rapid development has pushed temperatures into the danger zone. The threats are greatest in black, Latino and low-income communities, which are significantly hotter than wealthier, leafier parts of the city. ...Yet the city is working to fight the literal heat. The goal is for Phoenix to become the country’s first heat-ready city — equipped to survive a rapidly warming world. Each year, more Americans die from extreme heat than are killed by storms, floods and wildfires combined. In few places is the problem more pronounced than in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and its suburbs. In 2019, the region saw 103 days of triple-digit temperatures and 197 fatalities from heat-related causes. It was the highest number of heat-associated deaths on record for the county, and the fourth year in a row of record-setting heat deaths there. Those numbers are only expected to increase as the climate changes. ...Phoenix’s rapid development in recent decades has made it a victim of what researchers call the “heat island effect.” All the trademarks of the urban environment — towering glass buildings, bustling industry, vast expanses of concrete and asphalt — absorb and amplify the heat of the sun. ... Natural environments, he explained, are incredibly effective at getting rid of heat. That’s because of the way trees and other vegetation release water into the surrounding air, a process called evapotranspiration. ...Edison-Eastlake’s plan calls for repaving the sidewalks with materials that stay cool by reflecting the sun, installing shade structures at bus stops and creating tree-covered “talking spaces” in a planned park....

Excerpt: The United States is on track to produce more electricity this year from renewable power than from coal for the first time on record, new government projections show, a transformation partly driven by the coronavirus pandemic, with profound implications in the fight against climate change. It is a milestone that seemed all but unthinkable a decade ago, when coal was so dominant that it provided nearly half the nation’s electricity. ...powerful economic forces that have led electric utilities to retire hundreds of aging coal plants since 2010 and run their remaining plants less frequently. The cost of building large wind farms has declined more than 40 percent in that time, while solar costs have dropped more than 80 percent. ...As factories, retailers, restaurants and office buildings have shut down nationwide to slow the spread of the coronavirus, demand for electricity has fallen sharply. And, because coal plants often cost more to operate than gas plants or renewables, many utilities are cutting back on coal power first in response. ...The decline of coal has major consequences for climate change. Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, and its decline has already helped drive down United States carbon dioxide emissions 15 percent since 2005. This year, the agency expects America’s emissions to fall by another 11 percent, the largest drop in at least 70 years. While the pandemic has made these projections uncertain, the decline is expected to come partly because Americans aren’t driving as much, but mainly because coal plants are running less often....

The technology uses concentrated sunlight to turn carbon dioxide into industrial energy sources like syngas, which is used to produce jet fuel, diesel and other liquid fuels. ...Air Co. entered its vodka in a blind taste test at last year’s Luxury Masters competition and won a gold medal....

Excerpt: Scientists have shown that mineral carbonation can permanently capture and store carbon quickly enough and safely enough to rise to the challenge of climate change. In carbon storage experiments tied to geothermal power plants in Iceland, 90% of injected carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) transformed into minerals in just 2 years. Standard carbon storage methods can take thousands of years to do the same. <span style="background-color:transparent">“We are basing our methods on this natural process which is part of the big carbon cycle where all carbon on Earth derives from and ends up in rocks,” said one of the lead researchers, Sandra Snæbjörnsdóttir.

Excerpt: Some of the world’s largest financial institutions have stopped putting their money behind oil production in the Canadian province of Alberta, home to one of the world’s most extensive, and also dirtiest, oil reserves. In December, the insurance giant The Hartford said it would stop insuring or investing in oil production in the province, just weeks after Sweden’s central bank said it would stop holding Alberta’s bonds. And on Wednesday BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said that one of its fast-growing green-oriented funds would stop investing in companies that get revenue from the Alberta oil sands. They are among the latest banks, pension funds and global investment houses  to start pulling away from fossil-fuel investments amid growing pressure to show they are doing something to fight climate change....

Excerpt: To keep carbon out of the atmosphere, researchers argue that we need to return to one of the world’s oldest building materials: wood. ...Steel and concrete remain go-to materials for constructing new homes and commercial buildings. But although these materials are sturdy and durable, their manufacture and transport spew carbon into the atmosphere. ....microbes mastered carbon capture—photosynthesis—more than 3 billion years ago, with the first woody plants developing more than 300 million years ago. Churkina worked with a team of architects and scientists to calculate the benefits of using wood to build urban mid-rise buildings from 2020 to 2050. The team forecast four different scenarios. In the first, dubbed “business as usual,” 99.5% of new buildings would be built with steel and concrete. In the other three scenarios, 10%, 50%, or 90% of new buildings would be made from wood. The researchers estimate that the 90% scenario would keep up to 20 billion tons of carbon out of the atmosphere over the next 30 years....

Rockefeller built a vast fortune on oil. Now his heirs are abandoning fossil fuels. The family whose legendary wealth flowed from Standard Oil is planning to announce on Monday that its $860 million philanthropic organization, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, is joining the divestment movement [<a href="http://gofossilfree.org/" target="_blank">http://gofossilfree.org/</a>] that began a couple years ago on college campuses. The announcement, timed to precede Tuesday’s opening of the United Nations climate change summit meeting in New York City, is part of a broader and accelerating initiative.

In all, the groups have pledged to divest assets worth more than $50 billion from portfolios, and the individuals more than $1 billion, according to Arabella Advisors, a firm that consults with philanthropists and investors to use their resources to achieve social goals.... <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/us/heirs-to-an-oil-fortune-join-the-divestment-drive.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/us/heirs-to-an-oil-fortune-join-the-divestment-drive.html</a>.

The report will warn that the effects of human emissions of heat-trapping gases are already being felt, that the ultimate consequences could be dire, and that the window to do something about it is closing. “The evidence is overwhelming: Levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are rising,” says the report, which was made available early to The New York Times. “Temperatures are going up. Springs are arriving earlier. Ice sheets are melting. Sea level is rising. The patterns of rainfall and drought are changing. Heat waves are getting worse, as is extreme precipitation. The oceans are acidifying.” ...the report contains no new science. But the language in the 18-page report, called “<a href="http://whatweknow.aaas.org/" target="_blank">What We Know</a>,” is sharper, clearer and more accessible than perhaps anything the scientific community has put out to date. And the association does not plan to stop with the report. The group, with a membership of 121,200 scientists and science supporters around the world, plans a broad outreach campaign to put forward accurate information in simple language. The scientists are essentially trying to use their powers of persuasion to cut through public confusion over this issue. Polls show that most Americans are at least somewhat worried about global warming. But people generally do not understand that the problem is urgent — that the fate of future generations (not necessarily that far in the future) is being determined by emission levels now. Moreover, the average citizen tends to think there is more scientific debate about the basics than there really is. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/scientists-sound-alarm-on-climate.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/scientists-sound-alarm-on-climate.html</a>.

Relevant to GSS Climate Change chapter 10. Excerpt:  …a Canadian company …Carbon Engineering … plans to build a complete pilot plant by the end of 2014 for capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere…. …the oil industry … buys the gas to inject into oil fields to force out extra oil. ...The recovered carbon dioxide may be sold one day, not only for enhanced oil recovery, but also to feed algae to produce biofuel. It may also be sequestered in places like unmineable coal seams and oil and gas reservoirs, says a new Energy Department report. Gas capture would be extremely important in developing a rational price for carbon emissions, said Dr. Fox of the British mechanical engineering society. “Whatever it costs to take it out of the air and store it away,” Dr. Fox said, “that’s the price polluters would pay if they want to put carbon into the air.” … Another advantage of direct air capture is geographic flexibility. “It doesn’t matter where you take the carbon dioxide out,” he said, since the gas is mixed evenly in the earth’s atmosphere. “You could have air capture machines in the Australian desert to account for New York City car emissions.” ….

Highlights: we're probably not going to hit the 2°C target, and we can't even rule out a 5°C world. Research suggests that every 1C warming increases the risk of extinction for 10% of all species. Even if that's a 4-fold overestimate, it's still a profound result. Events that are already occurring at only 0.8°C above pre-industrial: wildfires, more intense hurricanes, droughts, the July 2012 Greenland melt, accelerating polar ice loss, arctic sea ice decline, ocean acidification, etc. It seems that even 2°C isn't "safe". There is a new understanding of aerosol forcings, which might increase the total anthropogenic radiative forcing from previous estimate ~1.6 W/m^2 to something more like 2.1 W/m^2. The last part of the talk is about finding ways to build a broad coalition of support for improving the efficiency and robustness of our infrastructure while we simultaneously try to decarbonize and feed more people with increasingly less food productivity. Sir Robert Watson also spoke at a session "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98M4i6tNgJ8&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">The Anthropocene: Confronting the Prospects of a +4°C World</a>."

By Henry Fountain, The NY Times. Excerpt: A California businessman chartered a fishing boat in July, loaded it with 100 tons of iron dust and cruised through Pacific waters off western Canada, spewing his cargo into the sea in an ecological experiment that has outraged scientists and government officials… The entrepreneur, Russ George, calling it a “state-of-the-art study,” said his team scattered iron dust several hundred miles west of the islands of Haida Gwaii, in northern British Columbia, in exchange for $2.5 million from a native Canadian group. The iron spawned the growth of enormous amounts of plankton, which Mr. George, a former fisheries and forestry worker, said might allow the project to meet one of its goals: aiding the recovery of the local salmon fishery for the native Haida. Plankton absorbs carbon dioxide, the predominant greenhouse gas, and settles deep in the ocean when it dies, sequestering carbon. The Haida had hoped that by burying carbon, they could also sell so-called carbon offset credits to companies and make money.... </p>

Excerpt: June broke or tied 3,215 high-temperature records across the United States. That followed the warmest May on record for the Northern Hemisphere – the 327th consecutive month in which the temperature of the entire globe exceeded the 20th-century average, the odds of which occurring by simple chance were 3.7 x 10-99, a number considerably larger than the number of stars in the universe. Meteorologists reported that this spring was the warmest ever recorded for our nation…. Scientists estimate that humans can pour roughly 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by midcentury and still have some reasonable hope of staying below two degrees [C] …the amount of carbon already contained in the proven coal and oil and gas reserves of the fossil-fuel companies, and the countries … that act like fossil-fuel companies…  the fossil fuel we're currently planning to burn… is … 2,795 [gigatons] – is higher than 565. Five times higher. …If you told Exxon or Lukoil that, in order to avoid wrecking the climate, they couldn't pump out their reserves, the value of their companies would plummet. John Fullerton, a former managing director at JP Morgan who now runs the Capital Institute, calculates that at today's market value, those 2,795 gigatons of carbon emissions are worth about $27 trillion. Which is to say, if you paid attention to the scientists and kept 80 percent of it underground, you'd be writing off $20 trillion in assets….

 Use chapter 3. Excerpt: The reversal of fortune in America’s energy 
supplies in recent years holds the promise of abundant and cheaper fuel,
 and it could have profound effects on what people drive, domestic 
manufacturing and America’s foreign policy.  …High energy prices led to a
 wave of successful oil and gas exploration in North America, including 
in fields that were deemed uneconomical only a few years ago. Using 
techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, oil 
companies are tapping into deeply buried reserves in shale rocks and in 
the ocean’s depths. …Ed Morse, head of global commodity research at 
Citigroup and a longtime energy analyst, says North America has the 
potential to become a "new Middle East." "The reduced vulnerability of 
North America — and the world market — to oil price spikes also has deep
 consequences geopolitically, including the reduced strategic importance
 to the U.S. of changes in oil- and natural gas-producing countries 
worldwide," Mr. Morse said in a recent 92-page report called Energy 
2020.  …The glut of natural gas supplies ... has effectively put an end 
in the United States to any new investment in coal plants, which produce
 much more emissions. But it also makes the economics of alternative, 
noncarbon energy sources like wind power or solar power difficult to 
justify without public support and subsidies.  …Natural gas prices have 
fluctuated wildly in recent years, rising to $14 for a thousand cubic 
feet from $2 within a few years. The current glut, however, has driven 
prices back down again, to near $2 for a thousand cubic feet. …Shipping 
costs may be lower, particularly if transportation companies shift their
 fleets to natural gas-powered or electric vehicles. …. Read the full

…"In terms of governmental policies, we need to be thinking about social context, not just the technology," York said. "We need to be asking what political and economic factors are conducive to seeing real displacement. Just developing non-fossil fuel sources doesn't in itself tend to reduce fossil fuel use a lot — not enough. We need to be thinking about suppressing fossil fuel use rather than just coming up with alternatives alone."…</p>

Schools across the country are turning to solar power as a way to simultaneously conserve energy and excite students about science. In Massachusetts, Diversified Construction Services, LLC, is erecting Solar Learning Labs (SLL) at 12 schools with support from a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the Department of Education. …“We’re trying to connect the curriculum to as pragmatic a situation as possible,” says Nick Young, superintendent of Hadley Public Schools in Hadley, Massachusetts. He anticipates about half of the district’s 300 middle and high school students will participate in courses using the SLL program. “This is a higher-end kind of program. It’s a way to connect to advanced subject matter. It’s a great opportunity for [self-motivated] students to be validated, and the hands-on application will appeal to some different learning styles, too.” During the installation of the solar panels, science teachers worked with Diversified. “It’s a school-based project. There’s an educational component built into construction,” explains Young. Although the panels will produce electricity on-site, Young admits it will be a “very modest amount.” <br />

By James H. Williams et al. Science. Abstract: Several states and countries have adopted targets for deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but there has been little physically realistic modeling of the energy and economic transformations required. We analyzed the infrastructure and technology path required to meet California’s goal of an 80% reduction below 1990 levels, using detailed modeling of infrastructure stocks, resource constraints, and electricity system operability. We found that technically feasible levels of energy efficiency and decarbonized energy supply alone are not sufficient; widespread electrification of transportation and other sectors is required. ...This transformation demands technologies that are not yet commercialized, as well as coordination of investment, technology development, and infrastructure deployment.

National Wildlife Federation. Excerpt: A "scientific" exhibit ignoring the threat of global warming at the taxpayer-funded Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC? Reports The New Yorker: "The David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, is a multimedia exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted with a giant graph charting the Earth’s temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than it was ten thousand years ago.  …The message… is that “key human adaptations evolved in response to environmental instability.” Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline “OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE,” is it noted that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum.  …<br />
                            Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClimateProgress.org, is infuriated by the Smithsonian’s presentation. “The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,” he said. “I think the Kochs wanted to be seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country. But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground funders of action to stop efforts to deal with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.”<br />
                          Cristián Samper, the museum’s director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as “one of the best donors we’ve had, in my tenure here, because he’s very interested in the content, but completely hands off.” He noted, 'I don’t know all the details of his involvement in other issues.'…"

By Jonathan Kay, National Post.  Excerpt: Have you heard about the “growing number” of eminent scientists who reject the theory that man-made greenhouse gases are increasing the earth’s temperature? It’s one of those factoids that, for years, has been casually dropped into the opening paragraphs of conservative manifestos against climate-change treaties and legislation.<br />
                            …Fine-sounding rhetoric--but all of it nonsense.  In a new article published in the Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences, a group of scholars from Stanford University, the University of Toronto and elsewhere provide a statistical breakdown of the opinions of the world’s most prominent climate experts. Their conclusion: The group that is skeptical of the evidence of man-made global warming “comprises only 2% of the top 50 climate researchers as ranked by expertise (number of climate publications), 3% of researchers in the top 100, and 2.5% of the top 200, excluding researchers present in both groups …”<br />
                            …Too many of us treat science as subjective — something we customize to reduce cognitive dissonance between what we think and how we live.<br />
                          ...The appropriate intellectual response to that challenge — finding a way to balance human consumption with responsible environmental stewardship — is complicated and difficult. It will require developing new technologies, balancing carbon-abatement programs against other (more cost-effective) life-saving projects such as disease-prevention, and — yes — possibly increasing the economic cost of carbon-fuel usage through some form of direct or indirect taxation. It is one of the most important debates of our time. Yet many conservatives have made themselves irrelevant in it by simply cupping their hands over their ears and screaming out imprecations against Al Gore.

Excerpt: Stanford, CA -- …National surveys released during the last eight months have been interpreted as showing that fewer and fewer Americans believe that climate change is real, human-caused and threatening to people. But a closer look at these polls and a new survey by my Political Psychology Research Group show just the opposite: huge majorities of Americans still believe the earth has been gradually warming as the result of human activity and want the government to institute regulations to stop it. <br />
 
                            …When respondents were asked if they thought that the earth’s temperature probably had been heating up over the last 100 years, 74 percent answered affirmatively. And 75 percent of respondents said that human behavior was substantially responsible for any warming that has occurred. <br />
 …Fully 86 percent of our respondents said they wanted the federal government to limit the amount of air pollution that businesses emit, and 76 percent favored government limiting business’s emissions of greenhouse gases in particular. Our findings might seem implausible in light of recent polls that purport to show that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the very existence of climate change.<br />

                           the most publicized question from a 2009 Pew Research Center poll: “From what you’ve read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?” This question measured perceptions of scientific evidence that the respondent has read or heard about, not the respondents’ personal opinions about whether the earth has been warming. <br />
 ...88 percent of the climate change issue public in our survey believed that global warming has been happening; 88 percent attributed responsibility for it to human action; 92 percent wanted the federal government to limit the amount of greenhouse gases that businesses can emit. Put simply, the people whose votes are most powerfully shaped by this issue are sending a nearly unanimous signal to their elected representatives.

By Celia Cole, The Guardian. Excerpt: A group of 255 of the world's top scientists today wrote an open letter aimed at restoring public faith in the integrity of climate science.<br />
                            In a strongly worded condemnation of the recent escalation of political assaults on climatologists, the letter, published in the US Journal Science and signed by 11 Nobel laureates, attacks critics driven by "special interests or dogma" and "McCarthy-like" threats against researchers. It also attempts to set the record straight on the process of rigorous scientific research.<br />
                            The letter is a response to negative publicity following the release of thousands of hacked emails from climate scientists at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and two mistakes makes by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN climate body.<br />
                            The letter sets out some basic features of the scientific method. "Like all human beings, scientists make mistakes, but the scientific process is designed to find and correct them. But when some conclusions have been thoroughly and deeply tested, questioned, and examined, they gain the status of 'well-established theories' and are often spoken of as 'facts'," it says....

Excerpt: ...Climatologists, who study weather patterns over time, almost universally endorse the view that the earth is warming and that humans have contributed to climate change. There is less of a consensus among meteorologists, who predict short-term weather patterns.<br />
                            Joe Bastardi, for example, a senior forecaster and meteorologist with AccuWeather, maintains that it is more likely that the planet is cooling, and he distrusts the data put forward by climate scientists as evidence for rising global temperatures.<br />
                            ...Such skepticism appears to be widespread among TV forecasters, about half of whom have a degree in meteorology. A study released on Monday by researchers at George Mason University and the University of Texas at Austin found that only about half of the 571 television weathercasters surveyed believed that global warming was occurring and fewer than a third believed that climate change was “caused mostly by human activities.”<br />
                            More than a quarter of the weathercasters in the survey agreed with the statement “Global warming is a scam,” the researchers found.<br />
                            ...A study released this year by researchers at Yale and George Mason found that 56 percent of Americans trusted weathercasters to tell them about global warming far more than they trusted other news media or public figures like former Vice President Al Gore or Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate....

                            Most climate scientists respond that
                            the ferocious storms are consistent

                              Called “Many Heavens, One Earth,” the
                              meeting is intended to generate commitments
                              for actions by religious organizations,
                              congregants and countries that could
                              reduce emissions of greenhouse gases
                              or otherwise limit the human impact

                            to be dismissed as science fiction
                            fantasies: cooling the planet with
                            sun-blocking particles or shades;
                            tinkering with clouds to make them
                            more reflective; removing vast quantities
                            of carbon from the atmosphere.<br />
                            Today this approach goes by the slightly
                            less grandiose name of climate engineering,
                            and it is looking more practical.
                            Several recent reviews of these ideas
                            conclude that cooling the planet
                            would be technically feasible and
                            economically affordable.<br />
                            ...The National Academy of Sciences
                            and Britain’s Royal Society
                            are preparing reports on climate
                            engineering, and the Obama administration
                            has promised to consider it. But
                            so far there has been virtually no
                            government support for research and
                            development — certainly nothing
                            like the tens of billions of dollars
                            allotted to green energy and other
                            programs whose effects on the climate
                            would not be felt for decades.<br />
                            For perhaps $100 million, climate
                            engineers could begin field tests
                            within five years, says Ken Caldeira
                            of the Carnegie Institution for Science.
                            Dr. Caldeira is a member of a climate-engineering
                            study group that met last year at
                            the Kavli Institute for Theoretical
                            Physics under the leadership of Steven
                            E. Koonin, who has since become the
                            under secretary for science at the
                            United States Department of Energy.
                            The group has just issued a report,
                            published by the Novim research organization,

                            back into space.<br />
                            These particles could be lofted into
                            the stratosphere to reproduce the
                            effects of sulfate aerosols from
                            volcanic eruptions like that of Mount
                            Pinatubo in 1991, which was followed
                            by a global cooling of nearly 1 degree
                            Fahrenheit. Just as occurred after
                            that eruption, the effects would
                            wane as the particles fell back to
                            Earth. Keeping the planet cooled
                            steadily (at least until carbon emissions
                            declined) might cost $30 billion
                            per year if the particles were fired
                            from military artillery, or $8 billion
                            annually if delivered by aircraft,

                            military, explored the potential
                            impact of a destructive flood in
                            Bangladesh that sent hundreds of

                              As debates over national and global
                              climate and energy policy continue
                              to drag out, there’s
                            been an  intensifying exploration
                            of climate miscommunication among
                            those seeking concrete actions that
                            will make a noticeable difference
                            in the atmosphere someday. If the
                            science pointing to a rising risk
                            of dangerous human interference with
                            climate is settled, the thinking
                            goes, then why aren’t people
                            and the world’s nations galvanized?
                            Maybe it’s a language problem?...<br />

                            said...his overall reaction was that
                            the commentators focusing on changing
                            how the climate issue is “framed” were
                            far too detached from the public
                            to have a meaningful idea of how

<blockquote> Everyone
                              associated with environmental communication
                              needs to read  The Cluetrain
                              Mainfesto of 1999 and take it to
                              heart. The environmental struggle
                              is one big exercise in persuasion.
                              What the Cluetrain folks pointed
                              out is that humans respond to human
                              voices. You can “frame” all
                              you want, but if the communication
                              is coming from robots, the only ones
                              who will respond will be the robots....The
                              bottom line is it only takes a few
                              seconds for people to listen to a
                              voice and decide whether they trust
                              it or not. If that voice is devoid
                              of human qualities, and worse if
                              there is a clear sense that the voice
                              is speaking with “messages” that
                              have been “framed” and “focus
                              grouped,” it just ain’t
                              gonna work for the masses. And
                              double that for the younger masses.<br />
                              ...You can come up
                              with all the clever terms you want,
                              but if they are spoken by environmental
                              leaders who are perceived as cold,
                              calculating, and manipulative,
                              the broader audience will simply
                              disconnect. Not because of the
                              language, but because of their
                              basic instincts leading them to
                              not trust the voice they are hearing....

                              Some of the most imaginative solutions
                              to the problem of global climate
                              change involve planetary-scale geoengineering
                              projects to reduce the sunlight reaching
                              the Earth’s
                              surface. But proposals like building
                              a huge sunshade in space or seeding
                              the atmosphere with sulfate particles
                              would cost enormous sums and require
                              a degree of international cooperation
                              that is difficult to achieve.<br />
                            Andy Ridgwell and colleagues at the
                            University of Bristol in England
                            have another idea, one they call
                            bio-geoengineering. Rather than developing
                            infrastructure to help cool the planet,
                            they propose using an existing one:
                            agriculture.<br />
                            Their calculations, published in
                            Current Biology, suggest that by
                            planting crop varieties that reflect
                            more sunlight, summertime cooling
                            of about 2 degrees Fahrenheit could
                            be obtained across central North
                            America and a wide band of Europe
                            and Asia.<br />
                            ...Plants reflect slightly different
                            amounts of light depending on factors
                            like how waxy the leaves are. Even
                            differences in growth patterns between
                            two varieties of a crop — the
                              way leaves are arranged — can
                              affect reflectivity.<br />
                            Existing varieties could be used,
                            Dr. Ridgwell said, or crops could
                            be bred or genetically engineered
                            for greater reflectivity (without
                            affecting yields, nutritional values
                            or other important characteristics)....<br />
                            But it wouldn’t cost much,
                              and it wouldn’t require much
                              international cooperation. “It’s
                              very practical, and it could just
                              be done,” he said. “It’s
                              not some trillion-dollar pie-in-the-sky
                            idea.”</p>

                            In its landmark Fourth Assessment
                            Report, the Intergovernmental Panel
                            on Climate Change (IPCC) declared
                            in 2007 that human influence on climate "has
                            been detected in every continent
                            except Antarctica". Now a paper
                            in Nature Geoscience says that our
                            impact can be found even in the last
                            wilderness.<br />
                            ..."The scarcity of observations
                            in the Antarctic makes it harder
                            to identify and attribute temperature
                            trends, but it does not make it impossible," says

                            Previous work has seen Antarctica
                            temperature records ranging from
                            1900 to the present day collated
                            into one data set. Gillett and his
                            colleagues compared changes detailed
                            in that data set with temperature
                            changes simulated in four different
                            climate models, running the models
                            both with and without human influence
                            factors.<br />
                            Changes actually observed did not
                            fit with the models when only natural
                            climate changes and variability were
                            present. They were only explainable
                            when human influence on the climate
                            was taken into account.<br />
                            ..."Warming in both polar regions

                            of how global warming has melted

                          Lewis Pugh has spent his life swimming
                          long distances....
                          Now, after months of tuition from Hungarian
                          kayaking champion Robert Hegedus, Mr
                          Pugh wants to become the first man
                          to paddle to the North Pole.<br />
"Nobody has ever attempted to
                          kayak to the pole before. In fact,
                          it would have been impossible last
                          year because it was frozen over," he
                          said.<br />
                          This year, for the first time, scientists
                          predict that the North Pole could briefly
                          be ice free and that has inspired Mr
                          Pugh to try to find a way through.<br />
                          On Saturday he is due to set off on
                          the 1200km (745 mile) expedition from
                          Norway to the North Pole - a journey
                          expected to take between two and three
                          weeks. A support ship will follow the
                          kayak to provide Mr Pugh with food
                          and respite from the brutal conditions.<br />
                          ...Until now, Lewis Pugh has been famous
                          for completing long distance swims
                          in all of the world's oceans. In 2006
                          the former lawyer swam the length of
                          the River Thames and then in 2007 he
                          swam 1km (0.6 miles) at the North Pole.<br />
                          On both occasions Mr Pugh said he wanted
                          to raise awareness of global warming
                          and its affect on the polar regions....</p>

                            vastly expand wind power in order
                            to halve greenhouse gas emissions
                            by 2050, according to an energy study
                            released Friday.<br />
"Meeting this target of 50 percent
                            cut in emissions represents a formidable
                            challenge, and we would require immediate
                            policy action and technological transition
                            on an unprecedented scale," IEA
                            Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka said.<br />
                            Environment ministers from the Group
                            of Eight industrialized countries
                            and Russia backed the 50 percent
                            target in a meeting in Japan last
                            month and called for it to be officially
                            endorsed at the G-8 summit in July.<br />
                            The study said that an average of
                            35 coal-powered plants and 20 gas-powered
                            power plants would have to be fitted
                            with carbon capture and storage equipment
                            each year between 2010 and 2050.<br />
                            In addition, the world would have
                            to construct 32 new nuclear power
                            plants each year, and wind-power
                            turbines would have to be increased
                            by 17,000 units annually. Nations
                            would have to achieve an eight-fold
                            reduction in carbon intensity — the
                            amount of carbon needed to produce
                            a unit of energy — in the transport
                            sector.<br />
                            Such action would drastically reduce
                            oil demand to 27 percent of 2005
                            demand. Failure to act would lead
                            to a doubling of energy demand and
                            a 130 percent increase in carbon
                            dioxide emissions by 2050, IEA officials
                            said.<br />
"This development is clearly
                            not sustainable," said Dolf
                            Gielen, an IEA energy analyst and
                            leader for the project.<br />
                            Gielen said most of the $45 trillion
                            forecast investment — about
                            $27 trillion — would be borne
                            by developing countries, which will
                            be responsible for two-thirds of
                            greenhouse gas emissions by 2050...</p>

                              WASHINGTON -- New observations
                              from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance
                              Orbiter indicate that the crust
                              and upper mantle of Mars are stiffer
                              and colder than previously thought.
                              The findings suggest any liquid
                              water that might exist below the
                              planet's surface and any possible
                              organisms living in that water, would
                              be located deeper than scientists
                              had suspected. [and here's the climate
                              part...] ...The radar pictures also
                              reveal four zones of finely spaced
                              layers of ice and dust separated
                              by thick layers of nearly pure ice.
                              Scientists think this pattern of
                              thick ice-free layers represents
                              cycles of climate change on Mars
                              on a time scale of roughly one million
                              years. Such climate changes are caused
                              by variations in the tilt of the
                              planet's rotational axis and in the
                              eccentricity of its orbit around
                              the sun. The observations support
                              the idea that the north polar ice
                              cap is geologically active and relatively
                              young, at about 4 million years.</p>

                            forces the Bush administration to
                            decide by mid-May whether polar bears
                            deserve protection under the Endangered

                            from the warming climate. ...Dana
                            Perino, the White House press secretary,
                            ...[said] in a briefing preceding
                            Mr. Bush's latest speech on climate,
                            the result was a looming "regulatory
                            train wreck. ...This would have the
                            Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species

                            that they were intended to"<br />
                            ...the administration... is pushing
                            for new oil and gas drilling in polar

                            Interior Department, prodded by legal
                            action, recommended the bear be given
                            threatened status under the species

                            ice.<br />
"Today's decision is a huge
                            victory for the polar bear," said
                            Kassie Siegel, climate program director
                            at the Center for Biological Diversity
                            and lead author of the 2005 petition,
                            filed by various environmental groups....<br />
                            According to ...the Natural Resources
                            Defense Council, which joined in
                            the suit, the court rejected a request
                            by the Interior Department for more
                            time, saying: "Defendants offer
                            no specific facts that would justify
                            the existing delay, much less further
                            delay. To allow Defendants more time
                            would violate the mandated listing

                            ...The Bush administration has argued
                            in various courts, including the
                            Supreme Court, that such efforts
                            will fail because, among other things,
                            the "remedy" for limiting
                            global warming must be applied globally,

                            A fresh study by a leading hurricane
                            researcher has raised new questions
                            about how hurricane strength and
                            frequency might, or might not, be
                            influenced by global warming. Eric
                            Berger of the Houston Chronicle nicely
                            summarized the research on Friday… That
                            work was supported by some subsequent
                            studies, but refuted by others. Despite
                            the uncertainty in the science, hurricanes
                            quickly became a potent icon in environmental
                            campaigns, as well as in "An
                            Inconvenient Truth," the popular
                            climate documentary featuring former
                            Vice President Al Gore. The message
                            was that global warming was no longer
                            a looming issue and was exacting
                            a deadly toll now.<br />
The new study, in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological
Society, is hardly definitive in its own right, essentially raising
more questions than it resolves. But it definitely rolls back
Dr. Emanuel's sense of confidence about a recent role for global
warming. (The <a href="http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1175/BAMS-89-3-347&amp;ct=1&amp;SESSID=e817c1eb5770903cb3fee4afd1d445a9" target="_blank">abstract
is here</a>. A <a href="ftp://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/Emanuel_etal_2008.pdf" target="_blank">pdf
is downloadable on Dr. Emanuel's ftp page</a>.)<br />
On his SciGuy blog, Eric discusses <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/sciguy/archives/2008/04/hurricanes_and_3.html" target="_blank">some
of the ramifications of Dr. Emanuel's new storm study</a>… They
are solid points that hold lessons for advocates on both sides
of the charged debate over climate science and its implications
for society. There are lessons here for journalists, too. Science
is a trajectory toward understanding, not a set of truths. Sometimes
that can be inconvenient, whether writing a headline or advocating
for a climate bill.<br />
But somehow society has to learn how to be comfortable with this
aspect of the scientific enterprise, while not fuzzing out because
things aren't crystal clear. As Stephen Schneider, a veteran
climatologist at Stanford, recently mused, the question is, "Can
democracy survive complexity?" It's
clear that Dr. Emanuel's admonition about the need for a lot
more work applies beyond the realm of science,
                          as well.                           </p>

                            along stream banks on misty slopes

                            was identified as the "trigger" in
                            the extinctions by the authors of

                            The "bullet," the researchers
                            said, appeared to be a chytrid fungus
                            that has attacked amphibian populations
                            in many parts of the world but thrives
                            best in particular climate conditions.
                            The authors, led by J. Alan Pounds
                            of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve

                            show that a recent mass extinction
                            associated with pathogen outbreaks
                            is tied to global warming." The
                            study was featured in reports last

                            Other researchers have been questioning

                            while important, could be a distraction,
                            particularly when considering the

                            like sitting in a house soaked in
                            gasoline, having just dropped a lit
                            match, and arguing about whether
                            we can actually see the flames yet,
                            while waiting to see if maybe it
                          might go out on its own."</p>

                            mountain glaciers, many of which
                            feed major rivers and water supplies,
                            are shrinking at an accelerating
                            pace as the climate warms, according
                            to a new report... issued Monday
                            by the World Glacier Monitoring Service,
                            which is based at the University
                            of Zurich and supported by the United
                            Nations Environment Program. ...The
                            study included data from 30 glaciers
                            spread around nine mountainous regions.<br />
                            ...The big danger ahead, several
                            glacier experts said, is that the
                            loss of glaciers would take away
                            a summertime source of river water,

"Millions of people depend on
                            the runoff from mountain snow and

                 C. REVKIN, NY Times. Excerpt:
                   JAKARTA, Indonesia, Dec. 2 - Thousands of
                   government officials, industry lobbyists,
                   environmental campaigners and observers are
                   arriving on the Indonesian island of Bali
                   for two weeks of talks starting Monday that
                   are aimed at breathing new life into the troubled
                   15-year-old global climate treaty.<br />
                   A heightened sense of urgency surrounds the
                   meeting in light of a report issued last month
                   by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel
                   on Climate Change, which detailed the potentially
                   devastating effects of global warming in the
                   panel's strongest language yet.<br />
                   ...By far, the biggest obstacle to forging
                   a new accord by 2009 is the United States,
                   analysts say. Senior Bush administration officials
                   say the administration will not agree to a
                   new treaty with binding limits on emissions.<br />
                   Instead, President Bush recently proposed
                   that the world's biggest countries work toward
                   a common, long-term goal set decades in the
                   future, without specific targets or limits,
                   and more immediate goals set by individual
                   nations using whatever means they choose.<br />
                   In his latest statement on climate change
                   last Wednesday, Mr. Bush said, "Our guiding
                   principle is clear: we must lead the world
                   to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions,
                   and we must do it in a way that does not undermine
                   economic growth or prevent nations from delivering
                   greater prosperity for their people."<br />
                   ...The United States will soon stand alone
                   among industrialized nations in its refusal
                   to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, with the new
                   Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, having
                   said in no uncertain terms that his country
                   would now ratify it.<br />
                   "The Bush administration is the only government in the
                   world that is opposed to mandatory emissions reductions being
                   included in a new treaty," said Philip Clapp, the deputy
                   managing director of the Pew Environment Group, based in Washington. "The
                   question is, will they block others from moving forward."<br />
                   While most developing countries - including
                   China, which is poised to overtake the United
                   States as the largest source of greenhouse
                   gases - have agreed to negotiate treaties
                   that require richer nations to reduce emissions,
                   they remain opposed to taking on such mandatory
                   limits themselves....</p>
<p>2007 November 23. <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/71691" target="_blank">The 'Geo-Engineering' Scenario. Why even a desperate measure is starting to look reasonable.</a> By Sharon Begley, Newsweek Web Exclusive. Excerpt: After decades spent studying volcanoes, Alan Robock can list 20 reasons why humans should not try to play God with the world's climate by, well, mimicking Krakatoa. Proponents of "geo-engineering" actually like the idea because the eruptions spread sulfate aerosols and other particles throughout the planet's atmosphere, reflecting incoming sunlight. The resulting cooling might counter the global warming caused by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. But that's not all sulfates do, which is where Robock's list comes in. The particles also deplete the planet's ozone layer, which is just starting to repair itself now that ozone-shredding chemicals are banned. They cause acid rain, too. And by cooling large land masses like Asia and Africa, the heat-reflecting particles reduce the temperature difference between them and the already-cooler oceans, which could stifle the monsoons that millions of people depend on for agriculture. Because the particles block direct sunlight more than diffuse rays, they also alter the balance of radiation reaching Earth's surface, with unknown consequences for plants that can be kind of finicky about the kind of sunlight they need.<br />
 And yet É In a sign of how dangerous global warming is starting to look and of how pitiful the world's efforts to control greenhouse gases are, even Robock-list and all-hedges his bets. Geo-engineering, allows the Rutgers University meteorologist, "might be held in reserve for an emergency."<br />
 ...Studies of volcanoes established what amount of particles produces how much cooling, as well as how the particles spread and how long they remain aloft (a year or two). Knowing this, it should be possible to roll back the global warming projected for 2100 enough to return the planet to its climate of 1900, Damon Matthews and Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution reported in June.<br />
 The devil, however, is in the details. Injecting sulfates into the atmosphere-by lofting big, aerosol-filled balloons or rockets-would reduce global precipitation to below the levels of 1900, their study showed, threatening agriculture. Cooling would be uneven, with some regions benefiting more than others....</p>

to Both Left and Right on Global Warming</a>. By ANDREW C. REVKIN. NY Times. Excerpt: For many years, the battle over what to think and do about human-caused climate change and fossil fuels has been waged mostly as a yelling match between the political and environmental left and the right.<br />
 The left says global warming is a real-time crisis requiring swift curbs on smokestack and tailpipe gases that trap heat, and that big oil, big coal and antiregulatory conservatives are trashing the planet.<br />
 The right says global warming is somewhere between a hoax and a minor irritant, and argues that liberals' thirst for top-down regulations will drive American wealth to developing countries and turn off the fossil-fueled engine powering the economy.<br />
 Some books mirror the divide, like the recent "Field Notes from a Catastrophe," ...by Elizabeth Kolbert, and "The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming" by Chris Horner, a lawyer for the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Ms. Kolbert sounds a strong warning call, and Mr. Horner's book fits with the position of the institute, a libertarian and largely industry-backed group that strongly opposes limits on greenhouse gases.<br />
 But in three other recent books, there seems to be a bit of a warming trend between the two camps. Instead of bashing old foes, the authors, all influential voices in the climate debate with roots on the left or the right, tend to chide their own political brethren and urge a move to the pragmatic center on climate and energy.<br />
 All have received mixed reviews and generated heated Internet debate ... "A Contract With the Earth," Mr. Gingrich, ... a manifesto challenging conservatives not just to grudgingly accept, but to embrace, the idea that a healthy environment is necessary for a healthy democracy and economy.<br />
 ... Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger in "Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility." ...call for an aggressive effort to invest in energy research, while also building societies that can be resilient in the face of the warming
                   that is already unavoidable....</p>

                 Meltdown</a>. By Andrew Revkin, for AARP magazine. Excerpt:
                   It's becoming a legacy issue for older Americans:
                   what type of planet are we leaving our children?
                   One of the nation's top reporters on the environment
                   reveals the latest science behind climate
                   change.<br />
                   KANGERLUSSUAQ, GREENLAND ...Great warmings
                   and coolings have sent ocean levels rising
                   and falling as enormous amounts of water were
                   locked in glaciers or released like the flows
                   we see here in Greenland.<br />
                   But the current warming trend is happening
                   much faster than previous hot spells, says
                   [snow scientist, Joe] McConnell, and none
                   of the forces that usually affect climate-such
                   as variations in the sun's strength-are in
                   sync with this recent change. Should these
                   patterns continue, he believes, the consequences
                   are clear. "If Greenland melted, it'd
                   raise sea levels by twenty feet," he
                   explains. "There goes most of the Mississippi
                   embayment. There go the islands in the South
                   Pacific. Bangladesh is obliterated. Manhattan
                   would have to put up dikes." A similar
                   amount of ice is vulnerable in western Antarctica,
                   another focus of McConnell's work. While this
                   would most likely be a slow-motion sea change
                   taking many centuries, gases being pumped
                   into the atmosphere by cars, planes, factories,
                   and power plants could raise the odds of such
                   a shift.<br />
                   ...It may be that what we face is less a climate
                   crisis than an energy challenge. Many experts
                   believe the key to limiting climate risks
                   and solving a host of momentous problems-including
                   the end of abundant oil-is to begin an ambitious
                   quest for new ways to conserve, harvest, and

                   Harnessing the power of the sun remains the
                   Holy Grail of most energy experts. But research

                   though the potential has been clear for decades.
                   Consider this incredibly prescient quote: "I'd

CONVERSATION WITH HEIDI CULLEN--Into the Limelight, and the Politics of Global Warming</a>. By CLAUDIA DREIFUS, NY Times. Excerpt: Heidi Cullen is the only climatologist with a Ph.D. in the country who has her own weekly show, a half-hour-long video-magazine focused on climate and the environment. ...In June 2002, Heidi Cullen, a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., received a telephone call from an executive at the Weather Channel. Would she audition for a program on climate and global warming that producers at the Atlanta-based cable television network were contemplating?...<br />
 Q: What were you studying when you got that call from the Weather Channel?<br />
 A: I was trying to understand the large-scale mechanisms that had caused a drought in Afghanistan from 1999 to 2001. I was also working with engineers in Brazil and Paraguay to apply climate forecasts to optimize water resource management at Itaipu Binacional, the largest operational hydropower facility in the world. I hesitated when I got that call. Television was a world I couldn't imagine. No one I knew had ever done anything like that....<br />
 Q: Your coverage of global warming has been controversial. Are you surprised?<br />
 A: In a way, yes. To me, global warming isn't a political issue, it's a scientific one. But a lot of people out there think you're being an advocate when you talk climate science....<br />
 Q: Rush Limbaugh accused you of Stalinism. Did you suggest that meteorologists who doubt global warming should be fired?<br />
 A: I didn't exactly say that. I was talking about the American Meteorological Society's seal of approval. I was saying the A.M.S. should test applicants on climate change as part of their certification process. They test on other aspects of weather science.<br />
 A lot of viewers want to know about climate change. They are experiencing events they perceive as unusual and they want to know if there's a connection to global warming. Certainly when Katrina hit, they wanted to know if it was global warming or not. Most Americans get their daily dose of science through their televised weather report. Given that fact, I think it's the responsibility
                   of broadcast meteorologists to provide viewers
                   with scientific answers....</p>

 Nantucket Homeowners Stake $25 Million in a War With the Sea</a>. Cornelia Dean, The New York Times. "When erosion became a serious threat to bluff-top homes in the village of Siasconset on the island's southeast shore and homeowners decided to fight back by replenishing the beach, cost was not an issue. About two dozen of the owners joined with other island residents to form the Sconset Beach Preservation Fund, whose members are seeking permission to spend at least $25 million of their own money to dredge 2.6 million cubic yards of sand from a few miles offshore and pump it onto a 3.1-mile stretch of beach in Siasconset, or Sconset, as it is called here. They realize that the sand will inevitably wash away, so they are prepared to do much of the work all over again, perhaps as often as every five years. If the sand had to be transported by dump trucks, it could take 260,000 trips at 10 cubic yards a trip. Instead, it will be dredged up from the ocean bottom, mixed with water and pumped to shore as a slurry that will spew out onto
                   the beach."</p>

                   tons of iron, an essential plankton nutrient,
                   over a 10,000-square-kilometer patch of ocean.
                   ...In an effort to ameliorate the effects
                   of global warming, several groups are working
                   on ventures to grow vast floating fields of
                   plankton intended to absorb carbon dioxide
                   from the atmosphere and carry it to the depths

                   is scheduled to get under way this month when

                   WESTMINSTER, Vt. - ...To do his bit to stave
                   off global warming, Mr. Crocker this year
                   converted his sugar house from regular fuel
                   oil to used vegetable oil. Such oil, sometimes
                   pumped into the tanks of environmentally friendly "grease
                   cars," can also be used as an alternative
                   to heating oil. While a dwindling number of
                   small, traditional sugar makers still boil
                   their sap over wood fires, the majority burn
                   heating oil, a fossil fuel that contributes
                   to global warming. Derived from living plants
                   rather than fossil fuels, used vegetable oil
                   adds little or no carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
                   Mr. Crocker buys his from a company that collects
                   it as a waste product from restaurants, then
                   filters and processes out the dirt and impurities.
                   By converting from traditional oil, Mr. Crocker
                   is taking a stand for the environment. As
                   an industry, Vermont's maple sugaring is highly
                   vulnerable to climate change. Last year, of
                   the 1.45 million gallons produced in the United
                   States, nearly a third came from Vermont.
                   The entire year's harvest of sap is gathered
                   during a short season, which generally begins
                   in March and ends by early April. ...That
                   short season of daily freeze-thaw cycles is
                   getting shorter. "Right now, the season
                   is starting about a week earlier throughout
                   New England than it did 40 years ago," said
                   Timothy Perkins, director of the Proctor Maple
                   Research Center at the University of Vermont,
                   who has been warning of the challenge posed
                   by global warming for a while now. "And
                   it's ending about 10 days earlier than it
                   did. Over 40 years, we've lost a net of three
                   days of the season." Three days may not
                   sound like much. But because the season lasts
                   only about a month, it represents about a
                   10 percent reduction in the crop....</p>

                   changes linked to global warming, are already
                   spending billions of dollars to limit their
                   own risks from its worst consequences, like
                   drought and rising seas. But despite longstanding
                   treaty commitments to help poor countries
                   deal with warming, these industrial powers
                   are spending just tens of millions of dollars
                   on ways to limit climate and coastal hazards
                   in the world's most vulnerable regions - most
                   of them close to the equator and overwhelmingly
                   poor. ..."The inequity of this whole
                   situation is really enormous if you look at

                   of the United Nations climate panel. ...The
                   lack of climate aid persists even though nearly
                   all the world's industrialized nations, including
                   the United States under the first President

                   to tackle global warming know that it causes
                   more harm than good. But they plough on regardless.
                   In theory, fuels made from plants can reduce
                   the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by cars
                   and trucks. Plants absorb carbon as they grow
                   - it is released again when the fuel is burned.
                   By encouraging oil companies to switch from

                   of Hurricane Katrina and cites research suggesting
                   that global warming will cause both storm
                   frequency and deadliness to rise. Yet this
                   past Atlantic season produced fewer hurricanes
                   than forecasters predicted (five versus nine),
                   and none that hit the United States. "We
                   need to be more careful in describing the
                   hurricane story than he is," Dr. Hansen
                   said of Mr. Gore. "On the other hand," Dr.
                   Hansen said, "he has the bottom line
                   right: most storms, at least those driven
                   by the latent heat of vaporization, will tend
                   to be stronger, or have the potential to be
                   stronger, in a warmer climate."...the
                   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change...
                   estimated that the world's seas in this century
                   would rise a maximum of 23 inches - down from
                   earlier estimates. Mr. Gore, citing no particular
                   time frame, envisions rises of up to 20 feet
                   and depicts parts of New York, Florida and
                   other heavily populated areas as sinking beneath
                   the waves, implying, at least visually, that
                   inundation is imminent. ..."Nowhere does
                   Mr. Gore tell his audience that all of the
                   phenomena that he describes fall within the
                   natural range of environmental change on our
                   planet," Robert M. Carter, a marine geologist
                   at James Cook University in Australia, said....</p>

Cramer, Analog Science Fiction and Fact Magazine.  Excerpt: …Is there anything that can be done to avert this global calamity?  Several technical fixes have been suggested.  One of them is based on the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions… The side-effects of such a remedy, however, appear to be as bad as the problem it is intended to fix.  Acid rain form the sulfuric acid formed from the sulfur dioxide would become the standard kind of rainfall, irreversibly altering the ecology of the planet.<br />
                 …Prof. Roger Angel of the University of Arizona, a prominent astronomer and creator of some of the world’s largest telescope mirrors, has proposed an interesting alternative.  He would like to place scatterers at the L1 Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system that would remove about 1.8% of the ambient sunlight.<br />
                 …What goes into the L1 orbit and how much will it cost?  The cheapest solution would be to place a light-absorbing dust cloud there.  However …one must instead use a “cloud” of autonomous sunshade spacecraft with “station-keeping” capabilities.  Angel’s unit sunshade spacecraft design is essentially a navigable sheet of silicon nitride containing holes with their centers placed 15 mm apart in a vast hexagonal planar array, so that light passing through the holes is coherently deflected in an interference pattern by a few degrees.  Each unit has a mass of about a ton (1000 kg) and has a shade area of about 2.4 square kilometers.<br />
                 …If the lifetime of the project is 50 years, than average annual cost would be $100 billion, about 0.2% of the world’s gross domestic product… Nevertheless, it’s an interesting idea, and it certainly has implications for science fiction as well as geopolitics. </p>

                 magazine, Union of Concerned Scientists. By
                 Erika Spanger-Siegfried. Excerpt:
                   Without deep cuts in heat-trapping emissions,
                   summers in New York near the end of the century
                   may feel as hot as Georgia summers do today.
                   Fortunately,<br />
                   it's not too late to preserve the traditional
                   character of our northeastern states.<br />
                   ...In recent decades, ... the characteristic
                   climate of the Northeast has begun to change
                   dramatically. Between 1970 and 2000 alone,
                   summer temperatures rose about one degree
                   Fahrenheit (¼F) and winter temperatures
                   rose nearly 4 ¼F. Spring is arriving
                   sooner, summers are growing hotter, and winters
                   are becoming warmer and less snowy.<br />
                   ...If global warming emissions continue unabated,
                   a number of large northeastern cities could
                   experience triple the number of days over
                   90 ¡F by mid-century. In the latter
                   part of the century, most of these cities
                   could experience more than 60 days per year
                   with temperatures topping 90 ¡F, and
                   some could experience as many as 80 days.
                   With lower emissions, roughly half this increase
                   is expected.<br />
                   ...Emphasizing the regional consequences of
                   global warming can motivate local policy makers.<br />
                   The findings of the October 2006 NECIA report
                   Climate Change in the U.S. Northeast have
                   not only received the attention of the region's

                   Tracey C. Rembert, the coordinator of corporate
                   governance and engagement for the Service
                   Employees International Union, acknowledges
                   that Wells Fargo is the country's largest
                   purchaser of renewable energy offsets and
                   has specialists on staff studying all of the
                   implications of climate change on its businesses.
                   Still, Ms. Rembert's union has filed a shareholder's
                   resolution asking Wells Fargo to specify how
                   it is addressing both the risks and market
                   opportunities presented by global warming.... "We
                   want them to rethink their business, and set
                   themselves up to take strategic advantage
                   of climate change," Ms. Rembert said.
                   The New York City Comptroller's Office feels
                   the same way about Dominion Resources, an
                   electric power and natural gas company, and
                   Massey Energy, a coal mining company. The
                   Sierra Club Mutual Fund feels that way about
                   the retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and the
                   Calvert Group about ACE Insurance. All of
                   them are calling upon companies to provide
                   proof that their business decisions also consider
                   issues involving climate change.... According
                   to Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental
                   groups, investors have filed 42 resolutions
                   asking for such information during the 2007
                   proxy season, up from 31 last year. And today,
                   Ceres will issue a list of 10 companies that
                   shareholders say are not looking at climate
                   change through an investor's eye and may not
                   be investing in alternative energy technologies. "This
                   has nothing to do with social investing," the
                   president of Ceres, Mindy S. Lubber, said. "These
                   investors are owners who want the companies
                   to stop being laggards when it comes to minimizing
                   risk and taking advantage of opportunities."....</p>

                   $25 million prize to anyone who figures out
                   how to remove a billion tons of carbon dioxide
                   per year from the atmosphere, Al Gore sat

                 Published: NY Times. Excerpt:
                   The iconic culprit in global warming is the
                   coal-fired power plant. It burns the dirtiest,
                   most carbon-laden of fuels, and its smokestacks
                   belch millions of tons of carbon dioxide, the
                   main global warming gas. So it is something
                   of a surprise that James E. Rogers, chief executive
                   of Duke Energy, a coal-burning utility in the
                   Midwest and the Southeast, has emerged as an
                   unexpected advocate of federal regulation that
                   would for the first time impose a cost for emitting
                   carbon dioxide. But he has his reasons. "Climate
                   change is real, and we clearly believe we are
                   on a route to mandatory controls on carbon dioxide," Mr.
                   Rogers said. "And we need to start now
                   because the longer we wait, the more difficult
                   and expensive this is going to be."  ..."Setting
                   a real price on carbon emissions is the single
                   most important policy step to take," said
                   Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental
                   economics program at Harvard University. "Pricing
                   is the way you get both the short-term gains
                   through efficiency and the longer-term gains
                   from investments in research and switching to
                   cleaner fuels." ...Mr. Rogers, who is also
                   chairman of the Edison Electric Institute,...
                   are also pushing for a carbon dioxide-pricing
                   policy to reduce the risk to their companies.
                   ...The two methods of pricing carbon are to
                   charge a tax on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted
                   into the air, or to place a cap on total emissions
                   and then let polluters trade permits to emit
                   a ton of carbon dioxide. Economists like William
                   D. Nordhaus of Yale and Mr. Cooper of Harvard
                   ... suggested an initial tax around $14 a ton
                   of carbon dioxide emitted, which he calculated
                   would translate roughly into a 100 percent tax
                   on coal and add 12 cents to each gallon of gasoline.
                   Such a tax would raise as much as $80 billion
                   a year in the United States. ...a cap-and-trade
                   system ... limit would be placed on overall
                   emissions, with polluters allocated permits.
                   Then, companies able to go below their emission
                   targets would be allowed to sell their unused "permits
                   to pollute" to companies that could not.
                   ... developing nations like China and India,
                   energy specialists say, would certainly avoid
                   joining any international effort on global warming
                   without an emphatic move by the United States....</p>

                   Climate Is Forcing World Cup Organizers to Adapt</a>,
                 By NATHANIEL VINTON Excerpt:
                   Nov. 26 - High temperatures in Europe have disrupted
                   the Alpine skiing World Cup, throwing the calendar
                   of the sport's premier circuit into disarray
                   and raising questions about the future of a
                   sport so vulnerable to climate change. "It
                   will very quickly be a big crisis for us if
                   we continue canceling races in December," said
                   Atle Skaardal, who oversees the women's portion
                   of the tour for the International Ski Federation.
                   On Saturday, race organizers in St. Moritz,
                   Switzerland, canceled World Cup races scheduled
                   for Dec. 9-10, saying temperatures were too
                   high for them to make artificial snow. Men's
                   races scheduled for that weekend in Val d'Isere,
                   France, are in peril, too, and the International
                   Ski Federation, which runs the World Cup, will
                   make a decision about that race Wednesday. There
                   is a chance that some of the canceled events
                   will be relocated to Colorado, where forecasters
                   predict a heavy snowstorm over the early part
                   of the week. Until Wednesday, when the F.I.S.
                   makes its final decision about the European
                   races, a number of World Cup athletes are stranded
                   in the United States, looking for training venues
                   and accommodations. Others will go home, and
                   possibly fly back if the races are indeed rescheduled
                   at Aspen or Beaver Creek - the two resorts considering
                   adopting the canceled European races. In recent
                   years, managers of some of the highest ski resorts
                   in the Alps have taken the extreme measure of

                   to decelerate the ravages of summer heat. Resorts
                   that do chose to have World Cup races - especially
                   those early in the season - have always cast
                   a worried eye on late-arriving winters. They
                   run the risk of a major financial hit, both
                   in operational costs and lost television marketing
                   value. Resorts playing host to World Cup events
                   must provide at least 100,000 Euros ($131,352)
                   in prize money for each race, production of
                   a live television broadcast feed, and accommodations

                 ENERGY CHALLENGE | EXOTIC VISIONS - How to
                 Cool a Planet (Maybe).</a> By WILLIAM J. BROAD. Excerpts:
                   In the past few decades, a handful of scientists
                   have come up with big, futuristic ways to
                   fight global warming: Build sunshades in orbit
                   to cool the planet. Tinker with clouds to
                   make them reflect more sunlight back into
                   space. Trick oceans into soaking up more heat-trapping
                   greenhouse gases.<br />
                   ...Dr. Angel outlined a plan to put into orbit
                   small lenses that would bend sunlight away
                   from earth - trillions of lenses, he now calculates,
                   each about two feet wide, extraordinarily
                   thin and weighing little more than a butterfly.<br />
                   ... Paul J. Crutzen ...paper newly examines
                   the risks and benefits of trying to cool the
                   planet by injecting sulfur into the stratosphere.
                   ...Dr. Broecker of Columbia proposed doing
                   so by lacing the stratosphere with tons of
                   sulfur dioxide, as erupting volcanoes occasionally
                   do. The injections, he calculated in the 80's,
                   would require a fleet of hundreds of jumbo
                   jets and, as a byproduct, would increase acid
                   rain. By 1997, such futuristic visions found
                   a prominent advocate in Edward Teller, a main
                   inventor of the hydrogen bomb. "Injecting
                   sunlight-scattering particles into the stratosphere
                   appears to be a promising approach," Dr.
                   Teller wrote in The Wall Street Journal. "Why
                   not do that?" ... John Latham, an atmospheric
                   physicist at the National Center for Atmospheric
                   Research in Colorado, told how he and his
                   colleagues had unsuccessfully sought for many
                   years to test whether spraying saltwater mists
                   into low ocean clouds might increase their
                   reflectivity. ...Other plans called for reflective
                   films to be laid over deserts or white plastic
                   islands to be floated on the world's oceans,
                   both as ways to reflect more sunlight into
                   space. Another idea was to fertilize the sea
                   with iron, creating vast blooms of plants
                   that would gulp down tons of carbon dioxide
                   and, as the plants died, drag the carbon into
                   the abyss. ...Critics of geoengineering argued
                   that it made more sense to avoid global warming
                   than to gamble on risky fixes. They called
                   for reducing energy use, developing alternative
                   sources of power and curbing greenhouse gases....</p>

                   Increases in key measures of Atlantic hurricane
                   activity over recent decades are believed
                   to reflect, in large part, contemporaneous
                   increases in tropical Atlantic warmth [e.g.,
                   Emanuel, 2005]. Some recent studies [e.g.,
                   Goldenberg et al., 2001] have attributed these
                   increases to a natural climate cycle termed
                   the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO),
                   while other studies suggest that climate change
                   may instead be playing the dominant role [Emanuel,
                   2005; Webster et al., 2005]. Using a formal
                   statistical analysis to separate the estimated
                   influences of anthropogenic climate change
                   from possible natural cyclical influences,
                   this article presents results indicating that
                   anthropogenic factors are likely responsible
                   for long-term trends in tropical Atlantic
                   warmth and tropical cyclone activity. In addition,
                   this analysis indicates that late twentieth
                   century tropospheric aerosol cooling has offset
                   a substantial fraction of anthropogenic warming
                   in the region and has thus likely suppressed
                   even greater potential increases in tropical

                 Big Heat Bucket</a>. By Michon Scott ·for
                 NASA Earth Observatory. Excerpt:
                   ... Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
                   and Goddard Institute for Space Studies have
                   learned to think of the ocean as ... Earth's "biggest
                   heat bucket." And like a bucket placed
                   under an overflowing sink, the ocean is filling
                   up with the heat that increasing levels of
                   greenhouse gases are preventing from escaping
                   to space. By comparing computer simulations
                   of Earth's climate with millions of measurements
                   of ocean heat content collected by satellites
                   and in-the-water sensors, a team of climatologists
                   and oceanographers has provided what leading
                   NASA climate scientist James Hansen calls
                   the "smoking gun" of human-caused
                   global climate change: a prediction of Earth's
                   energy imbalance that closely matches real-world
                   observations. ..."It turns out that the
                   atmosphere, the air, really can't hold that
                   much heat," explains Josh Willis, an
                   oceanographer with the California Institute
                   of Technology working at NASA's Jet Propulsion
                   Laboratory. Heat capacity is the amount of
                   energy that must be put into something to
                   change its temperature, and air has a very
                   low heat capacity. "If you put energy
                   into the ocean, on the other hand, its temperature
                   changes only very slightly."</p>

                   Pollution Engineering's October newsletter,
                   we asked two survey questions: 
                   "Should we control CO<font size="-2">2</font> emissions," and "Is
                   current technology available to adequately
                   control CO<font size="-2">2</font> emissions?" 
                   Your answers painted a grim picture;
                   67.9 percent believing we need to
                   cut down on this greenhouse gas,
                   but only 37.2 percent thought that
                   currently available technology could
                   do the job. ... Atmospheric CO<font size="-2">2</font> content
                   is up to 379 ppm from an estimated
                   280 ppm at the onset of the industrial
                   age. ... there's a very good chance
                   that Global Warming is being caused
                   by human activity. So doing something
                   about it now, if we can, hedges our
                   bets.But don't take that last qualifier
                   too lightly. According to our survey,
                   the readers of Pollution Engineering,
                   whom I would believe should know
                   more about this kind of thing than
                   the readers of MAD, or even National
                   Geographic for that matter, don't
                   think that currently available technology
                   can control CO<font size="-2">2</font>.
                   Certainly, international attempts
                   to do so support this position. Of
                   the 141 nations to ratify the Kyoto
                   Protocol, many are having a hard
                   time meeting their quotas - at last
                   count, only four European Union countries
                   were on track to meet their emissions
                   target - and some of those that aren't
                   can blame an economic crash (e.g.
                   Russia) more than regulatory efforts
                   for their success....The thinking
                   is that this act of global solidarity
                   can create an economic incentive
                   to produce new technology, and even
                   if we don't meet the official goal,
                   the effort will have done more than
                   enough good to justify itself. That
                   seems a lot more responsible than
                   a nation of SUVs pulling out because
                   the treaty's unfairly kind to a nation
                   of bicycles. ...the Department of
                   Energy has been researching a plan
                   to literally pump their CO<font size="-2">2</font> to
                   the bottom of the ocean, where it
                   will supposedly create a static cloud.
                   ...The best solution I've heard so
                   far is to put grass gardens on top
                   of our buildings. This would mean
                   installation and maintenance cost
                   hikes galore. But supposedly, grass
                   on the roof can significantly help
                   with insulation - lowering heating
                   costs to a degree - while also giving
                   residents and workers a pleasant
                   leisure area....

                   liberal lobbying groups is planning a boycott
                   of Exxon Mobil products to protest the company's
                   challenges to warnings about global warming
                   and its support for oil and gas exploration
                   in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
                   The boycott is part of a public relations
                   campaign to brand Exxon Mobil, the nation's

                   The spokesman, Russ Roberts, said Exxon
                   Mobil had committed to "investments

                   waters caused a plankton called a coccolithophore
                   to bloom in huge numbers, turning the water
                   an opaque turquoise color. "The short-tailed
                   shearwater couldn't see its prey," Smith
                   said.</p>

                   Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) SCHEDULED
                   FOR LAUNCH</a>. The
                     Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE)
                     is a NASA-sponsored satellite mission, scheduled
                     for launch January 25, 2003, that will provide
                     state-of-the-art measurements of incoming
                     x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, near-infared,
                     and total solar radiation. The measurements
                     provided by SORCE specifically address long-term
                     climate change, natural variability and enhanced
                     climate prediction, and atmospheric ozone
                     and UV-B radiation. These measurements are
                     critical to studies of the Sun; its effect
                     on our Earth system; and its influence on
                     humankind.</font></p>
