By Gokhan Danabasoglu and Jean-François Lamarque, Eos/AGU. Excerpt: Earth’s climate is the result of a complex network of interacting systems: air currents, ocean biogeochemistry, mountain ranges, and ice sheets, to name a few. Understanding how our climate evolves and predicting what it will look like under various scenarios require comparing and combining multiple models and simulations, each with its own strengths and focus areas. Earth science researchers are currently putting the most recent release of one such modeling system through its paces. The open-source Community Earth System Model (CESM) modeling framework is used for many purposes, including investigations of past and current climate, projections of future climate change, and subseasonal-to-decadal Earth system predictions. Its latest version, <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/">CESM<sub>2</sub></a>, was <a href="https://eos.org/articles/new-version-of-popular-climate-model-released">released in June 2018</a>, followed by several incremental releases that included additional, readily available model configurations. Compared with its predecessor, CESM2 offers researchers new capabilities, including more realistic representations of changes in Greenland’s ice sheet and interactions of agricultural crops with the Earth system, as well as detailed models of clouds and wind-driven ocean waves. ...The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and the transient climate response (TCR) are two properties that emerge from the coupled simulations. ECS represents the equilibrium change in global mean surface temperature after a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and TCR represents the change in global mean surface temperature around the time of CO<span style="font-size:13.333333015441895px">2</span> doubling when CO<span style="font-size:13.333333015441895px">2</span> increases by 1% per year. CESM<span style="font-size:13.333333015441895px">2</span> ECS values of 5.1°C–5.3°C are <a href="https://eos.org/research-spotlights/ice-age-testing-reveals-challenges-in-climate-model-sensitivity">considerably higher</a> than those produced by its previous versions, which had ECS values of about 4.0°C....

By Andrei Lapenis, Eos/AGU. Excerpt: In 1972, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko used a simple methodology to make climate predictions that remain surprisingly accurate today and that could serve as a new “business-as-usual” scenario. ...He predicted that Earth’s mean global temperature would increase about 2.25°C by 2070 and that the Arctic would no longer be covered by ice year-round by 2050 [Budyko, 1972]. (Budyko briefly discussed the part of his forecast dealing with Arctic ice in a 1972 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/EO053i010p00868">Eos article</a> cited more than 100 times since.) Despite his confidence in his work, he cautioned that his estimates were made under assumptions of a significantly simplified climate system and should be viewed accordingly [Budyko, 1972], so it might have surprised him to see how closely actual events aligned with his predictions. Comparing 2019 to 1970, Budyko predicted an increase in the global mean temperature of 1°C and the disappearance of about 50% of Arctic multiyear ice. Observations have borne out these trends, demonstrating that mean global temperature increased by 0.98°C over this period and that the extent of multiyear Arctic sea ice in September 2019 was about 46% smaller than in 1970...

The blazing first half of 2020 has made it incredibly likely that 2020 will finish the year as one of the five warmest years on record.

By Paul Voosen, Science Magazine. Excerpt: It seems like such a simple question: How hot is Earth going to get? Yet for 40 years, climate scientists have repeated the same unsatisfying answer: If humans double atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from preindustrial levels, the planet will eventually warm between 1.5°C and 4.5°C—a temperature range that encompasses everything from a merely troubling rise to a catastrophic one. Now, in a landmark effort, a team of 25 scientists has significantly narrowed the bounds on this critical factor, known as climate sensitivity. The assessment [<a href="https://climateextremes.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WCRP_ECS_Final_manuscript_2019RG000678R_FINAL_200720.pdf" target="_blank">see the assessment</a>], conducted under the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and publishing this week in Reviews of Geophysics, relies on three strands of evidence: trends indicated by contemporary warming, the latest understanding of the feedback effects that can slow or accelerate climate change, and lessons from ancient climates.

ONE AUGUST AFTERNOON IN 2010, Michael Mann was opening mail in his office at Penn State University when a dusting of white powder emerged from an envelope. ...Death threats weren’t exactly the kind of thing Mann ’89 had imagined as an undergrad at Cal, when he was first thinking about a life in academia. But his career as a climate scientist had attracted some very powerful and determined enemies. Over the years, he’d gotten used to verbal attacks and idle threats, but this was on a different level. He began to worry about his family’s safety. In the end, the powder proved to be cornstarch, but police gave Mann a hotline number just in case. He and his wife put it on the refrigerator. Mann’s troubles started a decade earlier. It was 1998 and the young scientist, then a postdoc at UMass Amherst, co-authored a study with the innocuous title, “Global-scale temperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries.” [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/33859" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/33859</a>] Published in the journal Nature that April, the paper aimed to reconstruct Earth’s temperatures going back six centuries. ...Mann and his collaborators relied on “proxy records”.... To climatologist Jerry D. Mahlman, the graph of the data looked like an upturned hockey stick—the long period of relatively stable temperatures formed the shaft, the last century’s spike was the blade. The image stuck, and it has been known ever since as the “hockey stick graph,” .... When Mann received the powder-filled envelope, he was in the thick of another hyped-up scandal dubbed “Climategate,” in which contrarians heisted more than 1,000 emails from Mann and other prominent climate scientists, took them out of context, and claimed they revealed an unparalleled level of scientific wrongdoing. (They didn’t.) ...MANN WAS FURTHER VINDICATED in October 2007 when he was one of hundreds of scientists who shared in the Nobel Peace Prize, along with former Vice President Al Gore. Mann was one of two scientists the IPCC singled out for their personal sacrifices....

By Eric Hand, Science Magazine. Excerpt: The Southern Ocean is famously stormy, home to waves taller than telephone poles. Yet 50 kilometers overhead, the weather is just as tempestuous, if less obviously so. Powerful waves in the air break and crash, dumping energy into the stratosphere and disrupting winds that help control the climate. ...Around the world, gravity waves often arise when winds shove air over a mountain range, although storms and jet streams can also touch them off. In each case, a parcel of air gets pushed up, and gravity pulls it down. It overshoots and bobs back up. When confined by overhead winds, the train of undulating air parcels plows ahead horizontally, leading to so-called lee waves that can shake up commercial flights. ... Some gravity waves crash in the upper stratosphere, about 50 kilometers up, but most keep rising into the mesosphere, where they can be seen causing ripples in the fluorescent glow of air molecules 90 kilometers up. They are even thought to create giant bubbles of plasma in the ionosphere more than 200 kilometers up, halfway to the International Space Station, causing trouble for radio communications. ...climate modelers struggle to take the waves into account. That’s not only because their sources are so variable, but also because their wavelengths of tens of kilometers can be smaller than the size of the grids that modelers break up Earth’s atmosphere into....

Excerpt: The Atlantic Ocean’s “conveyor belt,” a powerful current that drags warm water north before submerging it in the North Atlantic, has been humankind’s constant companion. For 8000 years, it has held steady, nourishing Western Europe with tropical warmth. But a new study of the current’s strength over the past half-million years suggests global warming may not shut down the current any time soon, as some scientists fear. Instead, it could trigger a replay of ancient events, when multiple bouts of warming caused rapid, centurylong swings in the current’s strength, sowing climate chaos that may have alternately chilled and warmed Europe....

Studies try to better explain what's happened.</a>  Excerpt: Any pause in global warming, such as it may have been during the first decade of the 21st century, might seem to be on its way out. Global average temperatures for May and June 2014 reached record levels of warmth. Last year ranked as somewhere between the second and sixth warmest on record globally, depending on the temperature records you pick. But if history is any guide, expect more pauses in the thermometer's climb toward a warmer world, thanks to the climate's natural variability. That's one implication of two recent studies exploring the pause with an eye toward testing the notions that global warming has ended, as some skeptics have asserted, and that fundamental problems with climate models prevented them from projecting the sudden slowdown in the rate of warming. ...For the skeptic community, "this is proof that global warming stopped and it's no longer a problem, so we don't need to worry about it," ...For scientists seeking to better understand how the climate system works, "it's a really compelling science problem,"  ...Modeling studies over the past several years have converged on natural variability as the most likely explanation for the hiatus in warming, with a decades-long cycle of warming and cooling of surface waters in the Pacific as the prime mover. ...Shaun Lovejoy, a physicist at McGill University in Montreal, looked at the question model-free by conducting a statistical analysis of measured temperatures going back to the 1880s as well as records reconstructed from natural stand-ins for thermometers going back as far as the 1500s. The goal was to answer a basic question: How unexpected are such hiatuses? Modelers were concluding that a hiatus "doesn't look that unlikely; it looks totally possible that it's natural," Dr. Lovejoy says. "But I actually tried to put a number on it, and the number in the end is that we expect such an event every 20 to 50 years."....  <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2014/0723/A-pause-in-global-warming-Studies-try-to-better-explain-what-s-happened" target="_blank">http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2014/0723/A-pause-in-global-warming-Studies-try-to-better-explain-what-s-happened</a>.

These particles promote cooling by reflecting sunlight back into space and helping clouds to form. ...The research, published in the journal Nature, fills in a major gap in our understanding, researchers say. ...the smell of pine, made up of volatile organic compounds, reacts with oxygen in the forest canopy to form these aerosols. ...They've discovered ultra-low volatility organic vapours in the air that irreversibly condense onto any surface or particle that they meet. ... this level of craziness is what gives them the special properties to stick to those smallest particles and help grow them up in size to become aerosols." ...The authors believe that this is playing a significant role in reducing the impact of rising temperatures. ..."In a warmer world, photosynthesis will become faster with rising CO2, which will lead to more vegetation and more emissions of these vapours," said lead author, Dr Mikael Ehn, now based at the University of Helsinki. "This should produce more cloud droplets and this should then have a cooling impact, it should be a damping effect." ...The scientists stress that the new understanding is not a panacea for climate change as forests will stop emitting vapours if they become too stressed from heat or lack of water.... <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26340038" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26340038</a>.

Mercer... paper, in the journal Nature, was titled “West Antarctic Ice Sheet and CO2 Greenhouse Effect: A Threat of Disaster.” ...Mercer pointed out the unusual topography of the ice sheet sitting over the western part of Antarctica. Much of it is below sea level, in a sort of bowl, and he said that a climatic warming could cause the whole thing to degrade rapidly on a geologic time scale, leading to a possible rise in sea level of 16 feet.  While it is clear by now that we are in the early stages of what is likely to be a substantial rise in sea level, we still do not know if Dr. Mercer was right about a dangerous instability that could cause that rise to happen rapidly, in geologic time. We may be getting closer to figuring that out.  An intriguing new paper comes from Michael J. O’Leary of Curtin University in Australia and five colleagues scattered around the world ..., published July 28 in Nature Geoscience, ...confirmed something we pretty much already knew. In the warmer world of the Eemian, sea level stabilized for several thousand years at about 10 to 12 feet above modern sea level. ...near the end of the Eemian, sea level jumped by another 17 feet or so, to settle at close to 30 feet above the modern level...in less than a thousand years...a geologic instant.... That, of course, augurs poorly for humans. Scientists at Stanford calculated recently that human emissions are causing the climate to change many times faster than at any point since the dinosaurs died out. We are pushing the climate system so hard that, if the ice sheets do have a threshold of some kind, we stand a good chance of exceeding it.... <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/science/timing-a-rise-in-sea-level.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/science/timing-a-rise-in-sea-level.html</a>.

In a study released today in the journal Science, Carolin and her colleagues outline 100,000-year-old rainfall conditions in Borneo, mapped from chemical clues in cave formations there. ...Researchers look for formations that have already fallen over or broken off, so as not to damage the cave,...and study the ancient atoms within to discover how old they are and how much rainfall there was at different points in their past (speleothems form when rainwater drips through the limestone, picking up acid and minerals that pile up in the cave). ...Stalagmites are “the next generation of climate records,” says Larry Edwards, an earth scientist at the University of Minnesota. ...Edwards pioneered the isotope dating technique that catalyzed a boom in speleothem studies over the last decade. Until recently, dating speleothems...Scientists needed to track down thorium and uranium isotopes that existed in absurdly small quantities, around one part per trillion, and their tools could only locate one out of ten million of those… like finding a needle in a haystack in a cave on a different planet. In the late eighties, Edwards began experimenting with different ways to use a mass spectrometer to improve the search, and today ...he says, “of all the climate records, [speleothems] are among the best dated.” ...benefits to stalagmites abound: They reach deep into history, up to 500,000 years in some cases, longer than most ice cores and far longer than tree rings. ...Where in the past paleoclimatologists had been mostly limited to ice at high altitudes and the poles, trees in temperate zones, and lakes with ancient sediment, once reading speleothems became easier “all of a sudden the rest of the world was opened for climate records,” Edwards says.... <a href="http://climatedesk.org/2013/06/slicing-open-stalagmites-to-reveal-climate-secrets/" target="_blank">http://climatedesk.org/2013/06/slicing-open-stalagmites-to-reveal-climate-secrets/</a>.

Excerpt: If there were one American industry that would be particularly worried about climate change it would have to be insurance, right? ...From Hurricane Sandy’s devastating blow to the Northeast to the protracted drought that hit the Midwest Corn Belt, natural catastrophes across the United States pounded insurers last year, generating $35 billion in privately insured property losses, $11 billion more than the average over the last decade. And the industry expects the situation will get worse. “Numerous studies assume a rise in summer drought periods in North America in the future and an increasing probability of severe cyclones relatively far north along the U.S. East Coast in the long term,” said Peter Höppe, who heads Geo Risks Research at the reinsurance giant Munich Re. “The rise in sea level caused by climate change will further increase the risk of storm surge.” Most insurers, including the reinsurance companies that bear much of the ultimate risk in the industry, have little time for the arguments heard in some right-wing circles that climate change isn’t happening, and are quite comfortable with the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is the main culprit of global warming. “Insurance is heavily dependent on scientific thought,” Frank Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America, told me last week. “It is not as amenable to politicized scientific thought.” ...the industry’s analysis of the risks it faces is evolving. One sign of that is how some top American insurers responded to a billboard taken out by the conservative Heartland Institute, a prominent climate change denier that has received support from the insurance industry. The billboard had a picture of Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who asked: “I still believe in global warming. Do you?” Concerned about global warming and angry to be equated with a murderous psychopath, insurance companies like Allied World, Renaissance Re, State Farm and XL Group dropped their support for Heartland. ...Eli Lehrer, a Heartland vice president who at the time led an insurance-financed project, left the group and helped start the R Street Institute, a standard conservative organization in all respects but one: it believes in climate change and supports a carbon tax to combat it. And it is financed largely with insurance industry money. Mr. Lehrer points out that a carbon tax fits conservative orthodoxy. It is a broad and flat tax, whose revenue can be used to do away with the corporate income tax — a favorite target of the right. It provides a market-friendly signal, forcing polluters to bear the cost imposed on the rest of us and encouraging them to pollute less. And it is much preferable to a parade of new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. ...“We are having a debate on the right about a carbon tax for the first time in a long time,” Mr. Lehrer said. ...global warming isn’t just devastating for society, but also bad for business.... <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/business/insurers-stray-from-the-conservative-line-on-climate-change.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/business/insurers-stray-from-the-conservative-line-on-climate-change.html</a>.

Excerpt:  ...In a warming world, increased temperature means that the atmosphere can hold and transport more water vapor—a 7% increase in atmospheric moisture content for every degree Celsius of warming in Earth's lower troposphere. This affinity for moisture affects the entire water cycle, throughout the global climate system. Change is especially reflected in increased patterns of evaporation and precipitation, and a corresponding increase in ocean surface salinity, since surface salinity patterns respond to water cycle changes. ...In the past 50 years, salinity differences—the marker of the oceanic water cycle—have intensified in the upper 700 m of the ocean. “Think of the ocean as a big rain gauge,” says John Toole, physical oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Salty regions become saltier because more water is exported through evaporation, and fresh regions become fresher because increased rainfall dilutes those regions more. ...Changing the ocean's salinity and temperature also affects its water density, which in turn plays a key role in how water circulates. ...it takes a long time for surface effects to change deep ocean circulation patterns....

Ed Orcutt (R), a member of the State Transportation Committee, defended the idea of a bike tax by saying, "Sorry, but I do think that bicyclists need to start paying for the roads they ride on rather than make motorists pay. When you are riding your bicycle, tell me what taxes are being generated by the act of riding your bicycle,” Orcutt said to the Seattle Bike Blog. Yet Orcutt's main support for the tax comes from his belief that riding a bicycle is worse than driving a car for the environment. "A cyclists [sic] has an increased heart rate and respiration. That means that the act of riding a bike results in greater emissions of carbon dioxide from the rider. Since CO2 is deemed to be a greenhouse gas and a pollutant, bicyclists are actually polluting when they ride," he said....

By Justin Gillis, The NY Times. Excerpt:  The greatest single uncertainty about climate change is how much the warming of the planet will feed on itself. As the temperature increases because of human emissions, feedbacks could cause new pools of carbon to be released into the atmosphere, magnifying the trend. Other types of feedbacks could potentially slow the warming. Over all, climate scientists have only best guesses about how these conflicting tendencies will balance out, though most of them think the net result is likely to be a substantial rise in the planet’s average temperature…one of the most worrisome potential feedbacks involves the permafrost that underlies a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. Buried in that frozen ground is a lot of ancient organic material, containing twice as much carbon as now exists in the atmosphere. The permafrost is starting to warm and the carbon to escape…In essence, the permafrost feedback is a big new emissions source that makes the math of controlling climate change harder than ever.…. </p>

Excerpt: Dr. Thompson, who has taught earth sciences at Ohio State University… routinely spent up to two months a year camped in dangerous conditions atop mountains…Hauling six tons of equipment to South America, Africa, Asia and Europe, he and his small team raced to recover long cylinders of ice from glaciers that had built up over thousands of years. The layers in those cylinders contained dust, volcanic ash, subtle variations in water chemistry, even the occasional frozen insect — a record of climatic and geologic changes that could be retrieved, preserved and interpreted like a series of tree rings. Dr. Thompson became one of the first scientists to witness and record a broad global melting of land ice. And his ice cores proved that this sudden, coordinated melting had no parallel, at least not in the last several thousand years. To some climate scientists, the Thompson ice core record became the most convincing piece of evidence that the rapid planetary warming now going on was a result of a rise in greenhouse gases caused by human activity…. <br />

…Yet the consistency among the three compilations masks large uncertainties in the raw data on which they are based. Hence the doubts, husbanded by many eager sceptics, about their accuracy. A new study, however, provides further evidence that the numbers are probably about right….<br />
…Marshalled by an astrophysicist, Richard Muller, this group, which calls itself the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature, is notable in several ways. …Its members (including Saul Perlmutter, who won the Nobel prize for physics this month for his work on dark energy) were mostly new to climate science. And Dr Muller, for one, was mildly sceptical of its findings….<br />
…Yet Berkeley Earth’s results, as described in four papers currently undergoing peer review, but which were nonetheless released on October 20th, offer strong support to the existing temperature compilations.

...[Copernicus] To most of those who were not concerned with the detailed study of celestial motions, Copernicus’s innovation seemed absurd and impious. Even when understood, the vaunted harmonies seemed no evidence at all. The resulting clamor was widespread, vocal, and bitter.<br />
...The progression of the global warming idea so far has been quite 
similar to that of Copernicanism. The idea that changes in atmospheric 
greenhouse gas concentrations can and do cause significant climate 
changes... was proposed qualitatively in 1864 by renowned physicist John
 Tyndall, when he discovered carbon dioxide’s opacity to IR radiation. 
In 1896 Nobel laureate Svante Arrhenius quantitatively predicted the 
warming to be caused in the future by coal burning; the prediction was 
tested and promoted by steam engineer Guy Callendar in the late 1930s. 
At first few could accept that humans were capable of inﬂuencing the 
climate of an entire planet, but over  time, and with more calculations,
 scientists found the possibility increasingly difficult to dismiss....<br />
...[Einstein] Even Albert Einstein was not immune to political backlash. His theory of general relativity ... undermined our most fundamental notions of absolute space and time... Though the theory predicted the anomalous perihelion shift of Mercury’s orbit, it was still regarded as provisional in the years following its publication in 1916. When observation, by Arthur Eddington and others, of a rare solar eclipse in 1919 confirmed the bending of light, it was widely hailed and turned Einstein into a celebrity. Elated, he was finally satisfied that his theory was verified. But the following year he wrote to his mathematician collaborator Marcel Grossmann:<br />

…The news release, echoed by the news media, claimed that Greenland had lost 15 percent of its permanent ice cover from 1999 to 2011. That translates to 125,000 cubic miles, according to a rough calculation by Etienne Berthier, a glaciologist with the University of Toulouse, enough melted ice to raise sea levels three to five feet.<br />
The corresponding map in the atlas itself indicated that significant portions of Greenland’s coastline had become ice-free.<br />
Glaciologists, previously bruised by an exaggerated claim about the melting of Himalayan glaciers in a 2007 United Nations report that became fodder for global warming skeptics, mobilized as a truth squad.<br />
On blogs, on radio programs and in newspaper columns, they stated emphatically that Greenland has not lost 15 percent of its ice cover in recent years. The retreat, they said, is more like one-tenth of 1 percent. They were quick to add that nobody at the atlas had consulted them....<br />

discounting evidence for global warming," said Robb Willer, UC Berkeley
social psychologist and coauthor of a study to be published in the

from a global perspective, how warm was the summer exactly? How did the
summer's temperatures compare with previous years? And was global
warming the "cause" of the unusual heat waves? Scientists at NASA's
Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City, led by
GISS's director, James Hansen, have analyzed summer temperatures and
released an update on the GISS website that addresses all of these
questions….<br />
…"Unfortunately, it is common for the public to take the most recent
local seasonal temperature anomaly as indicative of long-term climate
trends," Hansen notes. "[We hope] these global temperature anomaly maps
may help people understand that the temperature anomaly in one place in
one season has limited relevance to global trends."….<br />
...There’s much debate and discussion about whether global warming can
"cause" such extreme weather events. The answer -- both no and yes --
is not a simple one....<br />

If you have not delved into the thousands of e-mail messages and files
hacked from the computers of British climate scientists, let me give
you the closest thing to an executive summary. It is taken from a file
slugged HARRY_READ_ME, which is the log of a computer expert’s long
struggle to make sense of a database of historical temperatures. Here
is Harry’s summary of the situation:<br />
Aarrggghhh!<br />
That cry, in various spellings, is a motif throughout the log as Harry
tries to fight off despair. ...“It’s Sunday evening, I’ve worked all
weekend, and just when I thought it was done I’m hitting yet another
problem that’s based on the hopeless state of our databases. There is
no uniform data integrity. ...”<br />
Harry, whoever he may be, comes off as the most sympathetic figure in
the pilfered computer annals of East Anglia University, the British
keeper of global temperature records. While Harry’s log shows him
worrying about the integrity of the database, the climate scientists
are e-mailing one another with strategies for blocking outsiders’ legal
requests to see their data.<br />
...As the scientists denigrate their critics in the e-mail messages,
they seem oblivious to one of the greatest dangers in the
climate-change debate: smug groupthink. These researchers, some of the
most prominent climate experts in Britain and America, seem so focused
on winning the public-relations war that they exaggerate their
certitude — and ultimately undermine their own cause....</p>

active it's been in decades and the dimmest in a hundred years. The

unusual cold spell in Europe and North America, which lasted from about
1300 to 1850. The coldest period of the Little Ice Age, between 1645
and 1715, has been linked to a deep dip in solar storms known as the
Maunder Minimum. During that time, access to Greenland was largely cut
off by ice, and canals in Holland routinely froze solid. Glaciers in
the Alps engulfed whole villages, and sea ice increased so much that no
open water flowed around Iceland in the year 1695. But researchers are

Scientists studying climate change have long believed that while most
of the rest of the globe has been getting steadily warmer, a large part
of Antarctica – the East Antarctic Ice Sheet – has actually been
getting colder.<br />
But new research shows that for the last 50 years, much of Antarctica
has been warming at a rate comparable to the rest of the world. In
fact, the warming in West Antarctica is greater than the cooling in
East Antarctica, meaning that on average the continent has gotten
warmer, said Eric Steig, a University of Washington professor of Earth
and space sciences and director of the Quaternary Research Center at
the UW.<br />
..."Simple explanations don't capture the complexity of climate," Steig
said. "The thing you hear all the time is that Antarctica is cooling
and that's not the case. If anything it's the reverse, but it's more
complex than that. Antarctica isn't warming at the same rate
everywhere, and while some areas have been cooling for a long time the
evidence shows the continent as a whole is getting warmer."<br />
A major reason most of Antarctica was thought to be cooling is because
of a hole in the Earth's protective ozone layer that appears during the
spring months in the Southern Hemisphere's polar region. Steig noted
that it is well established that the ozone hole has contributed to
cooling in East Antarctica.<br />
"However, it seems to have been assumed that the ozone hole was
affecting the entire continent when there wasn't any evidence to
support that idea, or even any theory to support it," he said.<br />
"In any case, efforts to repair the ozone layer eventually will begin
taking effect and the hole could be eliminated by the middle of this
century. If that happens, all of Antarctica could begin warming on a
par with the rest of the world."...<br />

                     change 'making seas more salty'.</a> By
                     David Adam, The Guardian. <span>Excerpt:
                     Global warming is making the sea more salty,
                     according to new research that demonstrates
                     the massive shifts in natural systems triggered
                     by climate change.<br />
Experts at the UK Met Office and Reading University say warmer
temperatures over the Atlantic Ocean have significantly increased
evaporation and reduced rainfall across a giant stretch of water
from Africa to the Carribean in recent years. The change concentrates
salt in the water left behind, and is predicted to make southern
Europe and the Mediterranean much drier in future.<br />
Peter Stott of the Met Office, who led the study, said: "With
global warming we're talking about very big changes in the overall
water cycle. This moisture is being evaporated and transported
to higher latitudes."<br />
The team wanted to see whether manmade climate change could be
blamed for changes in salinity measured in the Atlantic....<br />
...further south towards the tropics, Atlantic waters have been
getting saltier – about 0.5% more since the 1960s.<br />
Using state-of-the-art climate models, the scientists simulated
events over both parts of the ocean with and without increased
levels of greenhouse gases....<br />
...for the mid Atlantic, the models showed that only human-driven
global warming could explain the increase in saltiness – the
first time such an explicit link has been made between climate
change and salinity....</span>

                     Temperatures May Dry Up Peat Bogs, Causing
                     Carbon Release.</a> By Henry Fountain, The
                     New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     ...A study in Nature Geoscience suggests
                     that northern bogs may lose a significant
                     portion of their peat as global temperatures
                     rise. Organic matter in the peat will decompose,
                     releasing carbon into the atmosphere.<br />
                     Ordinarily peat bogs are a huge carbon sink.
                     They consist of marsh grasses, trees and
                     other organic matter that, because of the
                     wet, oxygen-starved conditions, don’t
                     decay much. What’s more, peat generally
                     begets more peat: because it holds so much
                     water and blocks drainage, as it accumulates
                     the water table rises, reducing decay even
                     further.<br />
                     This water table-peat interaction is what
                     scientists call a positive feedback loop.
                     Takeshi Ise of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth
                     Science and Technology and colleagues looked
                     at what would happen to this process when
                     environmental conditions change.<br />
                     ...They found that higher temperatures would
                     in effect reverse the feedback loop: the
                     water table would drop, causing more peat
                     to dry and decompose.<br />
                     Over hundreds of years, their simulation
                     suggests, 40 percent of organic carbon could
                     be lost from bogs where the peat layer is
                     shallow, while in deep bogs, the losses
                     would be as much as 86 percent.</span></p>

                     Every day for the last 112 years, people

                     to dutifully record temperatures and weather

                     a remarkable data collection that has become
                     a climatological treasure chest.<br />
                     The problems that often haunt other weather
                     records — the station is moved, buildings

                     here because so much of this place has been
                     frozen in time. The weather has been taken
                     in exactly the same place, in precisely

                     dedicated people since Grover Cleveland
                     was president.<br />
                     For much of that time, those same weather
                     observers have also made detailed records
                     about recurring natural events, like the

                     the first witch hazel bush to bud in the
                     fall. Together, these two sets of data,
                     meticulously collected in the same area,
                     are beginning to offer up intriguing indicators
                     about climate change — not about what
                     is causing it but rather how it affects
                     the lives of animals, plants, insects and
                     birds....<br />
                     ...The record shows that on this ridge in
                     the Shawangunk Mountains, about 20 miles
                     south of the better-known Catskills, the
                     average annual temperature has risen 2.7
                     degrees in 112 years. Of the top 10 warmest
                     years in that time, 7 have come since 1990.

                     for rapid growth and dispersal in the Arctic

                     of many species during the mid-Pliocene

                     have relatives in the north Atlantic, and
                     the fossil record shows a lot of invasion
                     from the Pacific to the Atlantic at that
                     time, Vermeij said.<br />
                     When cold conditions returned, the Arctic
                     route was cut off, mostly by a lack of food.
                     As the ice melts, productivity in the Arctic
                     will rise and the northward march of the
                     mollusks will resume where it left off three
                     million years ago.<br />
                     ...But the invaders will not wipe out native
                     species, Vermeij said.... Instead, the invasion
                     will add new species and hybrids and increase
                     competition in the North Atlantic.<br />
  "The composition and dynamics of north Atlantic communities
  will change," Roopnarine said. "But whether that
  will help or harm local fisheries is an open question. Humans
  may have to adapt as well."<br />
                     ..."The interesting thing to me is
                     that the fossil record has something to
                     say about the consequences of global warming," Vermeij
                     said.</span></p>

                     New Twist in Penguins’ Already Uncertain
                     Future.</a> By Cornelia Dean, The New York
                     Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     P. Dee Boersma, a biologist at the University
                     of Washington, has been watching the Magellanic
                     penguins of Punta Tombo, in Argentina, for
                     almost 30 years. For most of that time,
                     their numbers have been declining: breeding
                     pairs are down 22 percent there since 1987,
                     she writes in Tuesday’s issue of BioScience.<br />
                     But the dwindling numbers do not just mean
                     the birds are suffering, Dr. Boersma writes.
                     Because penguins are “marine sentinels,” their
                     decline is a blunt message that their marine
                     environment is in trouble, chiefly from
                     overfishing and pollution from offshore
                     oil operations and shipping.<br />
                     Now, though, Dr. Boersma writes, they are
                     also threatened by climate change, which
                     is reducing sea ice and, as a result, the
                     abundance of the marine creatures the birds
                     eat. Magellanic penguins can swim almost
                     100 miles a day, she said in an e-mail message,
                     but to get enough to eat now they must venture
                     as much as 40 miles farther from their nests
                     than they did a decade ago.<br />
                     Some of the food shortage is fishing-related,
                     Dr. Boersma said, but some appears to be
                     caused by climate change. As glaciers and
                     sea ice retreat, she writes in her article, “even
                     small variations can have major consequences
                     for penguins.”<br />
                     Climate change further threatens the birds
                     because about half nest in burrows vulnerable
                     to flooding, which seems to be on the rise. “Climate
                     variation that brings more water to desert
                     environments may benefit humans, but it
                     will not help penguins,” Dr. Boersma
                     wrote Their troubles show that “we
                     have entered a new era of unprecedented
                     challenges for marine systems.”</span>...</p>

                     No ice at the North Pole.</a> By Steve Connor,
                     The Independent. <span>Excerpt:
                     It seems unthinkable, but for the first
                     time in human history, ice is on course
                     to disappear entirely from the North Pole
                     this year.<br />
                     The disappearance of the Arctic sea ice,
                     making it possible to reach the Pole sailing
                     in a boat through open water, would be one
                     of the most dramatic – and worrying – examples
                     of the impact of global warming on the planet.
                     Scientists say the ice at 90 degrees north
                     may well have melted away by the summer.<br />
  "From the viewpoint of science, the North Pole is just
  another point on the globe, but symbolically it is hugely important.
  There is supposed to be ice at the North Pole, not open water," said
  Mark Serreze of the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in
  Colorado.<br />
                     If it happens, it raises the prospect of
                     the Arctic nations being able to exploit
                     the valuable oil and mineral deposits below
                     these a bed which have until now been impossible
                     to extract because of the thick sea ice
                     above.<br />
                     Seasoned polar scientists believe the chances
                     of a totally ice-free North Pole this summer
                     are greater than 50:50 because the normally
                     thick ice formed over many years at the
                     Pole has been blown away and replaced by
                     huge swathes of thinner ice formed over
                     a single year.<br />
                     This one-year ice is highly vulnerable to
                     melting during the summer months and satellite
                     data coming in over recent weeks shows that
                     the rate of melting is faster than last
                     year, when there was an all-time record
                     loss of summer sea ice at the Arctic.<br />
  "The issue is that, for the first time that I am aware
  of, the North Pole is covered with extensive first-year ice – ice
  that formed last autumn and winter. I'd say it's even-odds
  whether the North Pole melts out," said Dr Serreze.</span>..</p>

                     Threatened by Rapid Retreat of Arctic Sea
                     Ice, NCAR Study Finds.</a> <span>Excerpt:
                     BOULDER—The rate of climate warming
                     over northern Alaska, Canada, and Russia
                     could more than triple during periods of
                     rapid sea ice loss, according to a new study
                     led by the National Center for Atmospheric
                     Research (NCAR). The findings raise concerns
                     about the thawing of permafrost, or permanently
                     frozen soil, and the potential consequences
                     for sensitive ecosystems, human infrastructure,
                     and the release of additional greenhouse
                     gases.<br />
  "Our study suggests that, if sea-ice continues to contract
  rapidly over the next several years, Arctic land warming and
  permafrost thaw are likely to accelerate," says lead author
  David Lawrence of NCAR.<br />
                     The research was spurred in part by events
                     last summer, when the extent of Arctic sea
                     ice shrank to more than 30 percent below
                     average, setting a modern-day record. From
                     August to October last year, air temperatures
                     over land in the western Arctic were also
                     unusually warm, reaching more than 4 degrees
                     Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above the
                     1978-2006 average and raising the question
                     of whether or not the unusually low sea-ice
                     extent and warm land temperatures were related.<br />
                     The team found that during episodes of rapid
                     sea-ice loss, the rate of Arctic land warming
                     is 3.5 times greater than the average 21st
                     century warming rates predicted in global
                     climate models. While this warming is largest
                     over the ocean, the simulations suggest
                     that it can penetrate as far as 900 miles
                     inland. The simulations also indicate that
                     the warming acceleration during such events
                     is especially pronounced in autumn. The
                     decade during which a rapid sea-ice loss
                     event occurs could see autumn temperatures
                     warm by as much as 9 degrees F (5 degrees
                     C) along the Arctic coasts of Russia, Alaska,
                     and Canada.<br />
  "An important unresolved question is how the delicate
  balance of life in the Arctic will respond to such a rapid
  warming," Lawrence says. "Will we see, for example,
  accelerated coastal erosion, or increased methane emissions,
  or faster shrub encroachment into tundra regions if sea ice
  continues to retreat rapidly?"...</span><br />

                     western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula
                     is home to a thriving biological community
                     that includes bottom-dwelling and free-swimming
                     animals, giant algae much like the kelp
                     of temperate latitudes, marine organisms
                     that shelter under or within sea ice, as
                     well as familiar avian and mammalian predators:
                     penguins, seals and whales. But the authors
                     of this article outline various ways in
                     which the peninsular ecosystem is on the
                     threshold of rapid change. Midwinter temperatures
                     have increased by 6 degrees Celsius since
                     the 1950s, sea ice has diminished in extent
                     and longevity, and sea water temperatures
                     are climbing. The loss of ice is detrimental
                     to krill and other organisms at the base
                     of the food chain. A once-common penguin
                     species is in decline on the peninsula,
                     whereas other species are expanding their
                     range. Further warming could allow large
                     predatory crabs to invade the bottom-dwelling
                     community and greatly alter its composition.

                     A recent report from the United Nations
                     contained a stunning statistic: One industry
                     is responsible for nearly 20% of the greenhouse
                     gases released int the atmosphere worldwide.
                     It isn't long-haul trucking, or air travel,
                     or stell-smelting vactories, or any of the
                     other exhaust-belching suspects ususally

                     It is the livestock industry.<br />

                     What Happens When Global Warming Turns Millions
                     of Destitute Muslims Into Environmental
                     Refugees?<br />
                     ...water, from the rivers, from the ocean,
                     from the ground, is this country's existential
                     curse. Bangladesh and its 150 million people
                     -- the world's seventh-largest population,
                     compressed into an area the size of Iowa
                     -- have somehow contrived to have too much
                     water, too little water, and more and more
                     water of the wrong kind.<br />
                     The long-range apocalypse facing the country
                     is global warming and the accelerating sea-level
                     rise that will accompany it. ...the daily
                     short-term menace is the steady northward
                     creep of salt from the Bay of Bengal. Today
                     the land is saturated with people; little
                     by little it is also becoming saturated
                     with salt.<br />
                     ...However, try asking the millions of people
                     in the Ganges Delta if they have too much
                     water -- at least of the kind they can use.
                     Over the last few centuries, the natural
                     course of the sacred river has shifted eastward,
                     redirecting the surge of freshwater that
                     used to dilute the salt inflow from the
                     Bay of Bengal. ...in 1970, India made things
                     worse by building a diversion dam across
                     the Ganges at Farraka, a few miles short
                     of the border. Indian engineers did this
                     to increase the flow of water into the Hooghly
                     River, which runs through Calcutta, ...
                     to provide a reliable supply of drinking
                     water to the city and to flush out the silt
                     that threatened to block navigation. Each
                     of these natural and man-made changes has
                     deepened Bangladesh's freshwater crisis,
                     ...many of the smaller rivers and channels
                     that used to thread through the Ganges Delta
                     have dried up and disappeared.<br />
                     It gets worse. There's also the scourge
                     that comes from the other direction, from
                     the Bay of Bengal, in the form of catastrophic
                     floods and cyclones.<br />
                     ... "Well, at the moment the sea level
                     is rising at about three millimeters a year" --
                     a little more than one-tenth of an inch
                     -- "but that's going to get worse.
                     The current projections deal with three
                     grades of sea-level rise -- 30 centimeters,
                     75 centimeters, one meter." He pauses. "Under
                     the most benign of these three scenarios,
                     there's going to be a permanent loss of
                     12 percent to 15 percent of our surface
                     area, with a present population of five
                     million to seven million."....</span></p>

                     A unique drilling project in the western
                     Ross Sea has revealed that Antarctica had
                     a much more eventful climate history than
                     previously assumed. A new sediment core
                     hints that the western part of the now-frozen
                     continent went through prolonged ice-free
                     phases - presumably offering a glimpse of
                     where our warming world might be heading.<br />
                       Researchers reported initial results from
                       ANDRILL, a US$30-million international
                       drilling project, on 16 April at the assembly
                       of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna.
                       During the past two years, the team has
                       extracted two cores, each containing some
                       1,200 metres of sediment, from the seabed
                       below the vast Ross Ice Shelf, a floating
                       extension of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
                       Together, the cores provide an almost
                       uninterrupted 17-million-year record of
                       Antarctica's climatic past. Palaeoclimatological
                       records from ice cores, although more
                       detailed and easier to interpret, cover
                       only the past 800,000 years or so. Now,
                       geologists say, Antarctica's history is
                       laid out much more clearly.<br />
  "We have every page of the book," says David Harwood,
  an ANDRILL scientist at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.<br />
                       ...During a warm period some 3.5 million
                       years ago, ...the ice sheet may have disappeared
                       completely for around 200,000 years, raising
                       sea levels globally by up to 10 metres.<br />
                       For the first time, the ANDRILL cores
                       show exactly how ice retreated rapidly
                       and quickly in Antarctica. "That
                       happened at a time when it was three to
                       four degrees warmer than today, owing
                       to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations,
                       which we will very likely reach again
                       soon," says Tim Naish, a project
                       leader at the Institute of Geological
                       and Nuclear Sciences in Lower Hutt, New

                     University of Colorado at Boulder calculations
                     indicate the record low minimum extent of
                     sea ice across the Arctic last September
                     has a three-in-five chance of being shattered
                     again in 2008 because of continued warming
                     temperatures and a preponderance of younger,
                     thinner ice.<br />
                     The forecast by researchers at CU-Boulder's
                     Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research
                     is based on satellite data and temperature
                     records and indicates there is a 59 percent
                     chance the annual minimum sea ice record
                     will be broken this fall for the third time
                     in five years. Arctic sea ice declined by
                     roughly 10 percent in the past decade, culminating
                     in a record 2007 minimum ice cover of 1.59
                     million square miles. That broke the 2005
                     record by 460,000 miles -- an area the size
                     of Texas and California combined.<br />
  "The current Arctic ice cover is thinner and younger than
  at any previous time in our recorded history, and this sets
  the stage for rapid melt and a new record low," said Research
  Associate Sheldon Drobot, who leads CCAR's Arctic Regional
  Ice Forecasting System group in CU-Boulder's aerospace engineering
  sciences department. Overall, 63 percent of the Arctic ice
  cover is younger than average, and only 2 percent is older
  than average, according to Drobot.</span></p>

                     Carbon Cuts Just a Fantasy?</a> By JOHN
                     TIERNEY <span>Excerpt:
                     What if there's no way to cut greenhouse
                     emissions enough to make a real difference?<br />
  …  It becomes a bit more clear that we may have
  set ourselves down the wrong path when we framed the challenge
  of mitigating greenhouse gases in terms of "reducing emissions"…  We
  must acknowledge up front that the world needs more energy.   The
  International Energy Agency projects that global energy demand
  will increase by 60% by 2030 and recent trends in China and
  elsewhere suggest that this may even be an underestimate. Consider
  also that published estimates suggest that 2 billion people
  or more currently lack access to electricity. Their energy
  needs have only one direction to go.<br />
  …There can be only two answers to this question. One
  is to develop new technologies of energy supply that are carbon
  neutral or, to take carbon dioxide out of the air in some manner. <br />
  …The conventional view is that putting a price on carbon
  will create incentives that motivate such innovation. "Incentives" mean
  (in the short term at least) creating economic discomfort and/or
  pain leading people to search for new technologies that cost
  less than those that emit carbon. But here is where the conventional
  approach founders on the realities of politics. Policy makers
  cannot be expected to impose upon their constituents discomfort
  and/or pain and expect to stay in office. So we see a lot of
  hand waving, talk of long term targets and timetables, emphasis
  on personal actions, while emissions continue to increase.<br />
  …Current efforts to price carbon may contribute in some
  small way to innovation, but they just as likely may lead to
  games/shenanigans or just expensive energy.<br />
                     Instead we should skip all of the middle
                     steps in trying to create incentives that
                     stimulate innovation and focus on policies,
                     and investments, that stimulate such innovation
                     directly. </span></p>

                     Levels Are Falling Over the Long Term Because
                     of Lower Basins</a>. By Henry Fountain,
                     NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     The idea of sea level changes in this era
                     of environmental concern and all the discussion
                     is about the effect of melting glaciers
                     and shrinking ice caps over the coming decades
                     or centuries.  But sea levels have
                     fluctuated greatly over much longer time
                     scales, and glaciers and ice caps have had
                     little to do with it. Instead, the changing
                     size and depth of the ocean basins is responsible.  A
                     study looked at factors that affect the
                     size and depth of the basins, including
                     the spreading of new crust at midocean ridges,
                     the subsidence of this crust as it ages
                     and the changes in area as the continents
                     drift.  The study, published in Science,
                     suggests that in the late Cretaceous period,
                     80 million years ago, the oceans were shallow,
                     and thus the sea level was high — about
                     550 feet higher than it is now. Since then,
                     though, as the ocean floors have aged, they
                     have become deeper and the sea level has
                     fallen.  Although in the near future
                     sea levels may rise, the researchers say
                     that in the long term the downward trend
                     will continue. Over the next 80 million
                     years, the sea level will fall by as much
                     as 390 feet.</span></p>

                     Several hundred people sat in a fifth-floor
                     ballroom at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in
                     Times Square on Monday eating pasta and
                     trying hard to prove that they had unraveled
                     the established science showing that humans
                     are warming the world in potentially disruptive
                     ways. ...One challenge they faced was that
                     even within their own ranks, the group -
                     among them government and university scientists,
                     antiregulatory campaigners and Congressional
                     staff members - displayed a dizzying range
                     of ideas on what was, or was not, influencing
                     climate.<br />
                     On Sunday night, the dinner speaker was
                     Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist with
                     a paid position at the antiregulatory Cato
                     Institute who says humans are warming the
                     climate - he projects a three-degree Fahrenheit
                     warming by 2100 - but disputes the value
                     of cutting emissions of heat-trapping gases.<br />
                     At lunch on Monday, the message from S.
                     Fred Singer, a physicist who runs a group
                     challenging climate orthodoxy, was that
                     climate change was mainly driven by vagaries
                     in the sun.<br />
                     ...The two-day gathering, which concludes
                     Tuesday, was organized by the Heartland
                     Institute, a Chicago group whose antiregulatory
                     philosophy has long been embraced by, and
                     financially supported by, various industries
                     and conservative donors.<br />
                     ...A centerpiece of the meeting was a short
                     report by 24 authors, led by Dr. Singer,
                     provocatively described as the "Nongovernmental
                     International Panel on Climate Change." Its
                     main conclusion was this: "Our findings,
                     if sustained, point to natural causes and
                     a moderate warming trend with beneficial
                     effects for humanity and wildlife." ...Kert

                     in your wineglass?</a> <span>A
                     conference in Barcelona looks at the effects
                     of global climate change on the world of
                     wine. By Corie Brown, Los Angeles Times
                     Staff Writer. Excerpt: BARCELONA, SPAIN
                     -- THE "post-classic" era of winemaking
                     is dawning, according to experts at the
                     second Climate Change &amp; Wine conference
                     in Barcelona, Spain, at the end of last
                     week. ...Scientists told winemakers and
                     other industry professionals at the gathering
                     to expect natural acidity to drop, colors
                     to fade and alcohol levels to rise. Aromas
                     could vanish. In short, wine may gradually
                     lose the complexity wine lovers appreciate.
                     And as rising levels of carbon dioxide encourage
                     out-of-control vegetative growth, the green,
                     herbaceous flavors consumers deplore may
                     well increase.<br />
                       ...PRATS and Lurton predicted that, in
                       Bordeaux, Merlot vineyards increasingly
                       will be replanted with Cabernet Sauvignon,
                       Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc,
                       Bordeaux varieties that do better in warmer
                       weather. ...Along Germany's Rhine Valley,
                       Loosen said he expects more Cabernet Sauvignon
                       and Syrah to be planted.<br />
                       ...Eventually, the global map of viable
                       winemaking regions will shift toward the
                       poles, northward in the Northern Hemisphere
                       and southward in the Southern Hemisphere.
                       Warm vineyards in today's warmest areas,
                       such as those in California's Central
                       Valley, may be abandoned. And new parts
                       of the globe including England, Denmark,
                       Belgium and the Patagonia regions of Chile
                       and Argentina will emerge as high-quality
                       producers.<br />
                       ... THE narrow coastal regions where cool
                       ocean breezes provide relief from rising
                       temperatures, including Russian River
                       Valley, Tasmania and Puget Sound, will
                       be premier wine areas -- along with high-elevation
                       deserts in places as different as China
                       and Arizona. As for such seemingly self-defeating
                       practices as the wine industry's fuel-burning
                       worldwide shipments of heavy glass bottles,
                       for example, some in the industry are
                       developing more environmentally sensitive
                       alternatives, such as lightweight plastic
                       containers. "We have to be able to
                       hold our heads up on our packaging," Smart
                       said. Whoa! Screaming Eagle in a bag-in-a-box
                       container? Not while international wine
                       consultant Michel Rolland counts that
                       Napa Valley winery among his clients.
                       The naysayer at the conference, Rolland
                       dismissed concerns about climate change. "Perhaps
                       the warming will stop? We don't know," he
                       said. "So far, climate change has
                       been very good for us."....</span></p>

                     ICE LOSS SPEEDS UP, NEARLY MATCHES GREENLAND
                     LOSS.</a> <span>Excerpt:
                     Ice loss in Antarctica increased by 75 percent
                     in the last 10 years due to a speed-up in
                     the flow of its glaciers and is now nearly
                     as great as that observed in Greenland,
                     according to a new, comprehensive study
                     by NASA and university scientists. In a
                     first-of-its-kind study, an international
                     team led by Eric Rignot of NASA's Jet Propulsion
                     Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and the University
                     of California, Irvine, estimated changes
                     in Antarctica's ice mass between 1996 and
                     2006 and mapped patterns of ice loss on
                     a glacier-by-glacier basis. They detected
                     a sharp jump in Antarctica's ice loss, from
                     enough ice to raise global sea level by
                     0.3 millimeters (.01 inches) a year in 1996,
                     to 0.5 millimeters (.02 inches) a year in
                     2006. ...The team found that the net loss
                     of ice mass from Antarctica increased from
                     112 (plus or minus 91) gigatonnes a year
                     in 1996 to 196 (plus or minus 92) gigatonnes
                     a year in 2006. A gigatonne is one billion
                     metric tons, or more than 2.2 trillion pounds.
                     These new <br />
                     results are about 20 percent higher over
                     a comparable time frame than those of a
                     NASA study of Antarctic mass balance last
                     March ...Rignot says the increased contribution
                     of Antarctica to global sea level rise indicated
                     by the study warrants closer monitoring...
                     Results of the study are published in February's
                     issue of Nature Geoscience.</span></p>

                     After enduring months on the coldest, driest
                     and windiest continent on Earth, researchers
                     today closed out the inaugural season on
                     an unprecedented, multi-year effort to retrieve
                     the most detailed record of greenhouse gases
                     in Earth's atmosphere over the last 100,000
                     years. Working as part of the National Science
                     Foundation's West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide
                     (WAIS Divide) Ice Core Project, a team of
                     scientists, engineers, technicians and students
                     from multiple U.S. institutions have recovered
                     a 580-meter (1,900-foot) ice core--the first
                     section of what is hoped to be a 3,465-meter
                     (11,360-foot) column of ice detailing 100,000

                     ice loss</a>. <span>Excerpt:
                     Increasing amounts of ice mass have been
                     lost from West Antarctica and the Antarctic
                     peninsula over the past ten years, according
                     to research from the University of Bristol
                     and published online this week in Nature
                     Geoscience. Meanwhile the ice mass in East
                     Antarctica has been roughly stable, with
                     neither loss nor accumulation over the past
                     decade....Over the 10 year time period of
                     the survey, the ice sheet as a whole was
                     certainly losing mass, and the mass loss
                     increased by 75% during this time. Most
                     of the mass loss is from the Amundsen Sea
                     sector of West Antarctica and the northern
                     tip of the Peninsula where it is driven
                     by ongoing, pronounced glacier acceleration.
                     In East Antarctica, the mass balance is
                     near zero, but the thinning of its potentially
                     vulnerable marine sectors suggests this
                     may change in the near future.</span></p>

                     of the tropical belt in a changing climate</a>.

                     J. Reichler. <span>Abstract:
                     Some of the earliest unequivocal signs of
                     climate change have been the warming of
                     the air and ocean, thawing of land and melting
                     of ice in the Arctic. But recent studies
                     are showing that the tropics are also changing.
                     Several lines of evidence show that over
                     the past few decades the tropical belt has
                     expanded. This expansion has potentially
                     important implications for subtropical societies
                     and may lead to profound changes in the
                     global climate system. Most importantly,
                     poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric
                     circulation systems, such as jet streams
                     and storm tracks, could result in shifts
                     in precipitation patterns affecting natural
                     ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources.
                     The implications of the expansion for stratospheric
                     circulation and the distribution of ozone
                     in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood.
                     The observed recent rate of expansion is
                     greater than climate model projections of
                     expansion over the twenty-first century,
                     which suggests that there is still much
                     to be learned about this aspect of global
                     climate change.</span>

                     Humanity is rapidly turning the seas acid
                     through the same pollution that causes global
                     warming, .... The process - thought to be
                     the most profound change in the chemistry
                     of the oceans for 20 million years - is
                     expected both to disrupt the entire web
                     of life of the oceans and to make climate
                     change worse.<br />
                     The warning is just one of a whole series
                     of alarming conclusions in a new report
                     published by the official Intergovernmental
                     Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which last
                     month shared the Nobel Peace Prize with
                     former US vice president Al Gore.<br />
                     ...The new IPCC report, which is designed
                     to give impetus to the negotiations, highlights
                     the little-known acidification of the oceans,
                     .... It concludes that emissions of carbon
                     dioxide - the main cause of global warming
                     - have already increased the acidity of
                     ocean surface water by 30 per cent, and
                     threaten to treble it by the end of the
                     century.<br />
                     ...the seas have already absorbed about
                     half of all the carbon dioxide emitted by
                     humanity since the start of the industrial
                     revolution,.... This has so far helped slow
                     global warming - which would have accelerated
                     even faster if all this pollution had stayed
                     in the atmosphere, already causing catastrophe
                     - but at an increasingly severe cost.<br />
                     The gas dissolves in the oceans to make
                     dilute carbonic acid, which is increasingly
                     souring the naturally alkali seawater. This,
                     in turn, mops up calcium carbonate, a substance
                     normally plentiful in the seas, which corals
                     use to build their reefs, and marine creatures
                     use to make the protective shells they need
                     to survive. These include many of the plankton
                     that form the base of the food chain on
                     which all fish and other marine animals
                     depend.<br />
                     ... something similar happened when a comet
                     hit Mexico's Yucatan peninsula 65 million
                     years ago, blasting massive amounts of calcium
                     sulphate into the atmosphere to form sulphuric
                     acid, which in turn caused the extinction
                     of corals and virtually all shell-building
                     species.<br />
  "Two million years went by before corals reappeared in
  the fossil record," ... it took "a further 20 million
  years" before the diversity of species that use calcium
  returned to its former levels.<br />
                     ...Getting agreement on a new treaty to
                     tackle climate change hangs on resolving
                     an "after you, Claude" impasse
                     between the United States and China, the
                     two biggest emitters of carbon dioxide,

                     in September 2007 were the eighth warmest

                     scientists at NOAA's National Climatic Data

                     The global surface temperature was the fifth

                     conditions. Thirty-eight of the 48 contiguous
                     states were warmer than average, and no
                     state was cooler than average for the month.<br />
                     ...Reports from farmers indicate that the
                     state's hay shortage could be as high as
                     800,000 round bales, forcing farmers to
                     seek other options for feeding cattle through
                     the winter. Farmers whose corn and soybean
                     crops were damaged by the drought have offered
                     to help livestock producers by baling and
                     selling their crops for animal feed.</span></p>

                     A few years ago, researchers modeling the
                     fate of Arctic sea ice under global warming
                     saw a good chance that the ice could disappear,
                     in summertime at least, by the end of the
                     21st century. Then talk swung to summer
                     ice not making it past mid-century. Now,
                     after watching Arctic sea ice shrink back
                     last month to a startling record-low area,
                     scientists are worried that 2050 may be
                     overoptimistic. "This year has been
                     such a quantum leap downward, it has surprised
                     many scientists," says polar researcher
                     John Walsh of the University of Alaska,
                     Fairbanks. "This ice is more vulnerable
                     than we thought." And that vulnerability
                     seems to be growing from year to year, inspiring
                     concern that Arctic ice could be in an abrupt,
                     irreversible decline. "Maybe we are
                     reaching the tipping point," says Walsh.</span> <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5847/33a/F1" target="_blank">Bad

                     Mark Serreze of the University of Colorado,
                     Boulder. Ice area plummeted to 4.13 million
                     square kilometers, down 43% from 1979. That's
                     a loss equivalent to more than two Alaskas.

                     Melt Unnerves the Experts</a><br />
                   By ANDREW C. REVKIN. <span>The
                   Arctic ice cap shrank so much this summer
                   that waves briefly lapped along two long-imagined
                   Arctic shipping routes, the Northwest Passage
                   over Canada and the Northern Sea Route over
                   Russia.<br />
                     Over all, the floating ice dwindled to an
                     extent unparalleled in a century or more,
                     by several estimates.<br />
                     Now the six-month dark season has returned
                     to the North Pole. In the deepening chill,
                     new ice is already spreading over vast stretches
                     of the Arctic Ocean. Astonished by the summer's
                     changes, scientists are studying the forces
                     that exposed one million square miles of
                     open water - six Californias - beyond the
                     average since satellites started measurements
                     in 1979.<br />
                     ...Scientists are also unnerved by the summer's
                     implications for the future, and their ability
                     to predict it.<br />
                     Complicating the picture, the striking Arctic
                     change was as much a result of ice moving
                     as melting, many say. A new study, led by
                     Son Nghiem at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
                     and appearing this week in Geophysical Research
                     Letters, used satellites and buoys to show
                     that winds since 2000 had pushed huge amounts
                     of thick old ice out of the Arctic basin
                     past Greenland. The thin floes that formed
                     on the resulting open water melted quicker
                     or could be shuffled together by winds and
                     similarly expelled, the authors said.<br />
                     The pace of change has far exceeded what
                     had been estimated by almost all the simulations
                     used to envision how the Arctic will respond
                     to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases
                     linked to global warming. But that disconnect
                     can cut two ways. Are the models overly
                     conservative? Or are they missing natural
                     influences that can cause wide swings in
                     ice and temperature, thereby dwarfing the
                     slow background warming?<br />
                     The world is paying more attention than
                     ever.<br />
                     Russia, Canada and Denmark, prompted in
                     part by years of warming and the ice retreat
                     this year, ratcheted up rhetoric and actions
                     aimed at securing sea routes and seabed
                     resources....</span></p>

                     about Climate Change</a>. By Rebecca Lindsey. <span>Excerpt:
                     ...Biological oceanographer Wayne Esaias
                     ... has made a career studying patterns
                     of plant growth in the world's oceans and
                     how they relate to climate and ecosystem
                     change, first from ships, then from aircraft,
                     and finally from satellites. But for the
                     past year, he's been preoccupied with his
                     bee hives, which started as a family project
                     around 1990 when his son was in the Boy
                     Scouts. According to his honeybees, big
                     changes are underway in Maryland forests.
                     The most important event in the life of
                     flowering plants and their pollinators-flowering
                     itself-is happening much earlier in the
                     year than it used to.<br />
                     ...From spring until fall, worker bees forage
                     from dawn until twilight over a radius of
                     up to about 5 kilometers from the hive,
                     bringing back pollen and nectar from plants
                     that are blooming. They turn the nectar
                     into honey, which feeds the colony in the
                     winter or when nectar and pollen are scarce.
                     As the bees stockpile honey, the hive weight
                     goes up....<br />
  "During the peak of the nectar flow, a good, strong colony
  can gain 10 to 20 pounds in one day," he says. "In
  Maryland, that goes on for a few weeks in late spring, and
  then, suddenly, it's over." For the remainder of the year,
  the weight of the hive dwindles as bees sustain themselves
  on the honey and pollen they have stockpiled during their three-to-four-week
  feeding frenzy. ..."Nearly every night in the spring and
  summer someone would go out weigh the hives," he said. "And
  I guess just because I am a scientist, I started writing these
  things down. ...One day, I just decided to plot it all up [on
  a graph], just out of curiosity. And what I saw was that although
  you do see a lot of variability from year to year due to climate
  events, there was a very noticeable long-term trend, with flowering
  and nectar flows getting earlier and earlier in the year."...records
  showed an advance in flowering (earlier blooming) beginning
  as far back as 1970.<br />
                     ...Esaias thinks that urbanization is mostly
                     responsible for the changes in flowering.
                     ...Urbanization creates a heat island, an
                     area where surface temperatures are much
                     higher than surrounding rural areas. Pavement,
                     less soil moisture, air pollution, and heat
                     generated by energy use conspire to raise
                     the city temperatures as much as 10 degrees
                     Fahrenheit (6 degrees Celsius) over surrounding
                     areas. ...As temperatures rise, spring comes
                     earlier. Earlier leaf emergence and flowering
                     have been observed in numerous cities across
                     the world.<br />
  "I am farther out from the city, and it took 15 years
  for the urban heat island effect to get here," he concludes.
  Between urbanization and global warming from greenhouse gases,
  temperatures will continue to rise in coming years; the acceleration
  in flowering times that Esaias' honeybees have documented so
  far may not be the end of the changes....</span></p>

<span>Excerpt:
                              The Arctic ice cap has collapsed
                              at an unprecedented rate this summer
                              and levels of sea ice in the region
                              now stand at record lows, scientists
                              have announced.<br />
                                Experts say they are "stunned" by
                                the loss of ice, with an area
                                almost twice as big as the UK
                                disappearing in the last week
                                alone. So much ice has melted
                                this summer that the Northwest
                                passage across the top of Canada
                                is fully navigable, and observers
                                say the Northeast passage along
                                Russia's Arctic coast could open
                                later this month.<br />
                                If the increased rate of melting
                                continues, the summertime Arctic
                                could be totally free of ice
                                by 2030.<br />
                                Mark Serreze, an Arctic specialist
                                at the US National Snow and Ice
                                Data Centre at Colorado University
                                in Denver, said: "It's amazing.
                                It's simply fallen off a cliff
                                and we're still losing ice." The
                                Arctic has now lost about a third
                                of its ice since satellite measurements
                                began thirty years ago, and the
                                rate of loss has accelerated
                                sharply since 2002.<br />
                                Dr Serreze said: "If you
                                asked me a couple of years ago
                                when the Arctic could lose all
                                of its ice then I would have
                                said 2100, or 2070 maybe. But
                                now I think that 2030 is a reasonable
                                estimate. It seems that the Arctic
                                is going to be a very different
                                place within our lifetimes, and
                                certainly within our childrens'
                                lifetimes."<br />
                                ...Changes in wind and ocean
                                circulation patterns can help
                                reduce sea ice extent, but Dr
                                Serreze said the main culprit
                                was man-made global warming.<br />
  "The rules are starting to change and what's changing
  the rules is the input of greenhouse gases."</span></p>

                     in Retreat</a>. By SOMINI SENGUPTA, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     ON CHORABARI GLACIER, India - This is how
                     a glacier retreats. At nearly 13,000 feet
                     above sea level, in the shadow of a sharp
                     Himalayan peak, a wall of black ice oozes
                     in the sunshine. A tumbling stone breaks
                     the silence of the mountains, or water gurgles
                     under the ground, a sign that the glacier
                     is melting from inside. Where it empties
                     out - scientists call it the snout - a noisy,
                     frothy stream rushes down to meet the river
                     Ganges.<br />
                     D.P. Dobhal, a glaciologist who has spent
                     the last three years climbing and poking
                     the Chorabari glacier, stands at the edge
                     of the snout and points ahead. Three years
                     ago, the snout was roughly 90 feet farther
                     away. On a map drawn in 1962, it was plotted
                     860 feet from here. Mr. Dobhal marked the
                     spot with a Stonehenge-like pile of rocks.<br />
                     Mr. Dobhal's steep and solitary quest -
                     to measure the changes in the glacier's
                     size and volume - points to a looming worldwide
                     concern, with particularly serious repercussions
                     for India and its neighbors. The thousands
                     of glaciers studded across 1,500 miles of
                     the Himalayas make up the savings account
                     of South Asia's water supply, feeding more
                     than a dozen major rivers and sustaining
                     a billion people downstream. Their apparent
                     retreat threatens to bear heavily on everything
                     from the region's drinking water supply
                     to agricultural production to disease and
                     floods.<br />
                     ...According to Mr. Dobhal's measurements,
                     the Chorabari's snout has retreated 29.5
                     feet every year for the last three years,
                     .... A recent study by the Indian Space
                     Research Organization, using satellite imaging
                     to gauge the changes to 466 glaciers, has
                     found more than a 20 percent reduction in
                     size from 1962 to 2001, with bigger glaciers
                     breaking into smaller pieces, each one retreating
                     faster than its parent. A separate study
                     found the Parbati glacier, one of the largest
                     in the area, to be retreating by 170 feet
                     a year during the 1990s. Another glacier
                     that Mr. Dobhal has tracked, known as Dokriani,
                     lost 20 percent of its size in three decades.
                     Between 1991 and 1995, its snout inched
                     back 55 feet each year....</span></p>

                     Key as Climate Change Curtails Western Water</a>.
                     SAN FRANCISCO, California (ENS) - <span>The
                     drought now parching Western states is a
                     taste of things to come, finds a new report
                     by the Natural Resources Defense Council
                     that assesses the effects of global warming
                     on water supplies in the West. ..."Global
                     warming will make it harder for farms and
                     cities to find water," said Barry Nelson,
                     study co-author and co-director of NRDC's
                     western water project. "The latest
                     global warming science is clear - drought-like
                     conditions are likely to increase. This
                     means that conservation and water use efficiency
                     will become our most important sources of
                     new water supply," Nelson said. Over
                     the past eight years, the Colorado River,
                     which supplies water to parts of Arizona,
                     California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico,
                     Utah and Wyoming, has received just over
                     half its average flow.<br />
                     Southern California is experiencing its
                     driest year on record. The state Department
                     of Water Resources predicts that every river
                     in the southern Sierra Nevada will receive
                     less than half of normal runoff this year.<br />
                     Global warming may cause winter precipitation
                     to fall as rain instead of snow, reducing
                     water supply from the snowpack.<br />
                     ...The report calls on regions to develop
                     cooperative solutions that meet their water
                     needs together with other benefits. For
                     example, groundwater de-salters in California's
                     Chino basin produce water supplies, while
                     cleaning up contaminated underground aquifers.
                     Urban stormwater retention programs designed
                     to reduce flooding and pollution can also
                     supply water. The report highlights wastewater
                     recycling as a promising solution because
                     it will not be affected by global warming,
                     but advises that traditional approaches
                     - dams, diversions and groundwater pumping
                     - are likely to perform poorly in the future.<br />

                     Weather May Bench a Baseball Staple.</a> By
                     Monica Davey, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     RUSSELL, Pa. — Careers at stake with
                     each swing, baseball players leave little
                     to sport when it comes to their bats. They
                     weigh them. They count their grains. They
                     talk to them.<br />
                     But in towns like this one, in the heart
                     of the mountain forests that supply the
                     nation’s finest baseball bats, the
                     future of the ash tree is in doubt because
                     of a killer beetle and a warming climate,
                     and with it, the complicated relationship
                     of the baseball player to his bat.<br />
                     ...As early as this summer, federal officials
                     hope to set loose Asian wasps never seen
                     in this country with the purpose of attacking
                     the emerald ash borer, an Asian beetle accused
                     of killing 25 million ash trees in Michigan,
                     Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Maryland since
                     it was spotted in the United States five
                     years ago.<br />
                     ...Along with the ash borer beetle, a warming
                     of the local climate could also affect the
                     ash used for bats, some scientists say.
                     As temperatures rise, the ash wood that
                     now makes an ideally dense but flexible
                     bat might turn softer because of a longer
                     growing season. Eventually, some scientists
                     predict, the ash tree could vanish from
                     the region.<br />
                     ...“We’re watching all this
                     very closely,” said Brian Boltz, the
                     general manager of the Larimer &amp; Norton
                     company, whose Russell mill each day saws,
                     grades and dries scores of billets destined
                     to become Louisville Slugger bats. “Maybe
                     it means more maple bats. Or it may be a
                     matter of using a different species for
                     our bats altogether.”...</span></p>

                     Scientists have found that elevated carbon
                     dioxide levels may negatively impact the
                     relationship between some plants and insects.
                     Elevated CO2 is considered to be a serious
                     catalyst of global change. Its effects can
                     be felt throughout the ecosystem, including
                     the insect-plant food chain link... Many
                     plants have inherent enzyme-based defenses
                     that are released during insect attack.
                     This study found that when soybeans were
                     exposed to elevated amounts of CO2 the plants
                     became more susceptible to attack by Japanese

                     A swath of marshy, wildlife-rich coastal
                     land in Arctic Alaska being eyed for oil
                     drilling is eroding rapidly probably because
                     of the disappearance of sea ice that used
                     to protect it from the ocean waves, according
                     to a study released on Monday. Using satellite
                     data and maps compiled from aerial photographs,
                     scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey,
                     or USGS, found that land lost to erosion
                     north of Teshekpuk Lake, Arctic Alaska's
                     largest lake, was twice as fast in 1985
                     to 2005 period than in the previous 30 years...
                     In addition, salty sea water has contaminated
                     formerly freshwater lakes, migratory birds,
                     caribou and other wildlife populations has
                     lost habitat and the sparse human infrastructure
                     along the coastline has been damaged, the
                     study said... 'The area (Teshekpuk Lake)
                     is one of the most important areas in the

                     also believed to hold vast amounts of untapped
                     oil. In recent years, the Bush administration
                     lifted a decades-long ban on oil development
                     and has tried to sell oil and gas exploration

                     Struggle in a Warning World</a>. By William
                     Mullen, The Chicago Tribune. <span>Excerpt:
                     On a cloudy spring day, the first gray Adelie
                     penguin chicks are hatching out in round
                     pebble nests strewn across a bleak, rocky
                     coastline, poking their heads from beneath
                     the snowy-white shirt front of an adult
                     for their first blinking look at the world...
                     These days, however, Adelies are being stalked
                     by a threat they cannot see and cannot fight
                     off: the weather. The birds, which have
                     adapted over millions of years to the most
                     extreme climate on Earth, are beginning
                     to die off by the tens of thousands as a
                     result of global warming. The Adelie penguin
                     is regarded as an 'indicator' species, an
                     animal so delicately attuned to its environment
                     that its survival is threatened as soon
                     as something goes wrong. So as temperatures
                     rise, Adelies are among the first to feel
                     the effects, early victims of the devastating
                     worldwide changes that scientists expect
                     if the warming persists and intensifies...
                     In this vulnerable area, entire colonies
                     of Adelie penguins have died because, researchers
                     believe, the ice no longer extends far enough
                     into the sea to allow the birds to reach
                     their winter feeding grounds. Biologist
                     William Fraser monitors a 50-square-mile
                     area where 56,000 Adelies have perished...
                     For now, such deaths represent a small fraction
                     of the world's estimated 8 million to 10
                     million Adelie penguins, which live only
                     on Antarctica... But the die-offs scientists
                     are seeing in the warmest areas of Antarctica
                     are expected to spread as temperatures continue
                     to rise... The reason is simple, he said:
                     'Penguins don't see well in the dark.' Below
                     the Antarctic Circle, the hours of sunlight
                     shrink during winter until it is dark 24
                     hours a day. That is one key reason Adelie
                     penguins migrate: They must travel far enough
                     north so there is enough sunlight for a
                     successful daily hunt. Otherwise, they will
                     starve. A warmer Antarctic climate may shrink
                     the winter ice so much that it strands the
                     birds too far south, in places where the
                     sun doesn't rise, and the lights may go
                     out permanently for the Adelies.</span></p>

                     By William Yardley. New York Times.<br />
<span>Excerpt:
                              Many of Alaska’s roads, runways,
                              railroads and water and sewer systems
                              will wear out more quickly and
                              cost more to repair or replace
                              because of climate change, according
                              to a study released yesterday.
                              Higher temperatures, melting permafrost,
                              a reduction in polar ice and increased
                              flooding are expected to raise
                              the repair and replacement cost
                              of thousands of infrastructure
                              projects as much as $6.1 billion
                              for a total of nearly $40 billion — about
                              a 20 percent increase — from
                              now to 2030, according to the study...
                              The cost estimates are based on
                              the needs of nearly 16,000 pieces
                              of public infrastructure, including
                              airports and small segments of
                              roads. ... Temperatures have risen
                              by an average of two to five degrees
                              in different parts of the state
                              in recent decades, and the changes
                              have already been linked to problems
                              like coastal erosion in remote
                              Alaskan villages and wildfires.
                              ...“There are a million other
                              issues related to climate change,” said
                              Peter Larsen, a natural resource
                              economist at the Institute for
                              Social and Economic Research and
                              the lead researcher for the report. “This
                              is just one component, but it’s
                              a critical piece because this is
                              where all the goods and services
                              come through the state’s
                              economy, is through the infrastructure.” ...</span></p>

                     JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Global
                     warming isn't just a matter of melting icebergs
                     and polar bears chasing after them. It's
                     also Lake Chad drying up, the glaciers of
                     Mt. Kilimanjaro disappearing, increasing
                     extreme weather, conflict and hungry people
                     throughout Africa. According to a landmark
                     effort to assess the risks of global warming,
                     Africa -- by far the lowest emitter of greenhouse
                     gases in the world -- is projected to be
                     among the regions hardest hit by environmental

                     WALTER GIBBS. <span>Excerpt:
                     OSLO - Mainstream climatologists who have
                     feared that global warming could have the
                     paradoxical effect of cooling northwestern
                     Europe or even plunging it into a small
                     ice age have stopped worrying about that
                     particular disaster, although it retains
                     a vivid hold on the public imagination.<br />
                     The idea, which held climate theorists in
                     its icy grip for years, was that the North
                     Atlantic Current, an extension of the Gulf
                     Stream that cuts northeast across the Atlantic
                     Ocean to bathe the high latitudes of Europe
                     with warmish equatorial water, could shut
                     down in a greenhouse world....<br />
                     All that has now been removed from the forecast.
                     Not only is northern Europe warming, but
                     every major climate model produced by scientists
                     worldwide in recent years has also shown
                     that the warming will almost certainly continue.<br />
  "The concern had previously been that we were close to
  a threshold where the Atlantic circulation system would stop," said
  Susan Solomon, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and
  Atmospheric Administration. "We now believe we are much
  farther from that threshold, thanks to improved modeling and
  ocean measurements. The Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic
  Current are more stable than previously thought."....</span></p>

                     Rise in India Buries Islands and a Way of
                     Life</a>. By SOMINI SENGUPTA. New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     Shyamal Mandal lives at the edge of ruin.
                     In front of his small mud house lies the
                     wreckage of what was once his village on
                     this fragile delta island near the Bay of
                     Bengal. Half of it has sunk into the river.
                     ...The sinking of Ghoramara can be attributed
                     to a confluence of disasters, natural and
                     human, not least the rising sea. The rivers
                     that pour down from the Himalayas and empty
                     into the bay have swelled and shifted in
                     recent decades, placing this and the rest
                     of the delicate islands known as the Sundarbans
                     in the mouth of daily danger. Certainly
                     nature would have forced these islands to
                     shift size and shape, drowning some, giving
                     rise to others. But there is little doubt,
                     scientists say, that human-induced climate
                     change has made them particularly vulnerable.
                     A recent study by Sugata Hazra, an oceanographer
                     at Jadavpur University in nearby Calcutta,
                     found that in the last 30 years, nearly
                     31 square miles of the Sundarbans have vanished
                     entirely. More than 600 families have been
                     displaced, according to local government
                     authorities. Fields and ponds have been
                     submerged. Ghoramara alone has shrunk to
                     less than two square miles, about half of
                     its size in 1969, Mr. Hazra's study concluded.
                     Two other islands have vanished entirely.

                     Greenland is cold and hot. It's a deep freezer
                     storing 10 percent of Earth's ice and a
                     subject of fevered debate. If something
                     should melt all that ice, global sea level
                     could rise as much as 7 meters (23 feet).
                     Greenland and Antarctica - Earth's two biggest
                     icehouses - are important indicators of
                     climate change and a high priority for research,
                     as highlighted by the newly inaugurated
                     International Polar Year. Just a few years
                     ago, the world's climate scientists predicted
                     that Greenland wouldn't have much impact
                     at all on sea level in the coming decades.
                     But recent measurements show that Greenland's
                     ice cap is melting much faster than expected.
                     These new data come from the NASA/German
                     Aerospace Center's Gravity Recovery and
                     Climate Experiment (Grace). …Grace
                     measurements have revealed that in just
                     four years, from 2002 to 2006, Greenland
                     lost between 150 and 250 cubic kilometers
                     (36 to 60 cubic miles) of ice per year. …."Before
                     Grace, the change of Greenland's ice sheet
                     was inferred by a combination of more regional
                     radar and altimeter studies pieced together
                     over many years, but Grace can measure changes
                     in the weight of the ice directly and cover
                     the entire ice sheet of Greenland every
                     month," says Michael Watkins, Grace

                     have to pay attention," Velicogna adds. "These
                     ice sheets are changing much faster than
                     we were expecting. Observations are the
                     most powerful tool we have to know what
                     is going on, especially when the changes
                     - and what's causing them - are not obvious."<br />

                     warming: enough to make you sick Rising
                     temperatures are redistributing bacteria,

                     Oysterman Jim Aguiar had never had to deal
                     with the bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus
                     in his 25 years working the frigid waters
                     of Prince William Sound…. By summer
                     2004, the temperature had risen just enough
                     to poke above the crucial 59-degree mark.
                     Cruise ship passengers who had eaten local
                     oysters were soon coming down with diarrhea,
                     cramping and vomiting - the first cases
                     of Vibrio food poisoning in Alaska that
                     anyone could remember. As scientists later
                     determined, the culprit was not just the
                     bacterium, but the warming that allowed
                     it to proliferate."This was probably
                     the best example to date of how global climate
                     change is changing the importation of infectious
                     diseases," said Dr. Joe McLaughlin,
                     acting chief of epidemiology at the Alaska
                     Division of Public Health, who published
                     a study on the outbreak…. Incremental
                     temperature changes have begun to redraw
                     the distribution of bacteria, insects and
                     plants, exposing new populations to diseases
                     that they have never seen before…...The
                     temperature change has been small, about
                     1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 150
                     years, but it has been enough to alter disease
                     patterns across the globe…….According
                     to a landmark United Nations report released
                     this month, global warming has reached a
                     point where even if greenhouse gas emissions
                     could be held stable, the trend would continue
                     for centuries. The report painted a grim
                     picture of the future - rising sea levels,
                     more intense storms, widespread drought.
                     Predicting the future of disease, however,
                     has proven difficult because of myriad factors
                     - many of which have little to do with global
                     warming. Diseases move with people, they
                     follow trade routes, they thrive in places
                     with poor sanitation, they develop resistance
                     to medicines, they can blossom during war
                     or economic breakdowns….. </span> </p>

                     January ever recorded worldwide in 2007:
                     US scientists</a>. <span>Excerpt:
                     NEW YORK (AFP) - World temperatures in January
                     were the highest ever recorded for that
                     month of the year, US government scientists
                     said. "The combined global land and
                     ocean surface temperature was the highest
                     for any January on record," according
                     to scientists from the National Oceanic
                     and Atmospheric Administration's National
                     Climate Data Center in Asheville, N.C. The
                     combined global land and ocean surface temperature
                     was 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit (0.85 Celsius)
                     warmer than the 20th-century average of
                     53.6 degrees F (12 C) for January based
                     on preliminary data, NOAA said. ...Land
                     surface temperature was a record 3.40 F
                     (1.89 C) warmer than average, while global
                     ocean surface temperature was the fourth
                     warmest in 128 years, about 0.1 F (0.05
                     C) cooler than the record established during
                     the very strong El Nino climate phenomenon
                     in 1998.<br />
                     A moderate El Nino started in September
                     and continued into January before weakening,
                     NOAA said. El Nino is an occasional seasonal
                     warming of the central and eastern Pacific
                     Ocean that upsets normal weather patterns
                     from the western seaboard of Latin America
                     to East Africa, and potentially has a global
                     impact on climate. "The presence of
                     El Nino along with the continuing global
                     warming trend contributed to the record
                     warm January," NOAA said. "The
                     unusually warm conditions contributed to
                     the second lowest January snow cover extent
                     on record for the Eurasian continent," it
                     said. "During the past century, global
                     surface temperatures have increased at a
                     rate near 0.11 F (0.06 C) per decade, but
                     the rate of increase has been three times
                     larger since 1976, or 0.32 F (0.18 C) per
                     decade, with some of the largest temperature
                     increases occurring in the high latitudes
                     of the Northern Hemisphere," it said.</span></p>

                     STUDY FINDS WARMER FUTURE COULD BRING DROUGHTS</a>. <span>Excerpt:
                     NASA scientists may have discovered how
                     a warmer climate in the future could increase
                     droughts in certain parts of the world,
                     including the southwest United States. The
                     researchers compared historical records
                     of the climate impact of changes in the
                     sun's output with model projections of how
                     a warmer climate driven by greenhouse gases
                     would change rainfall patterns. They found
                     that a warmer future climate likely will
                     produce droughts in the same areas as those
                     observed in ancient times, but potentially
                     with greater severity. ...said Drew Shindell,
                     NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies,
                     New York "There is some evidence that
                     rainfall patterns already may be changing.
                     Much of the Mediterranean area, North Africa
                     and the Middle East rapidly are becoming
                     drier. If the trend continues as expected,
                     the consequences may be severe in only a
                     couple of decades. These changes could pose
                     significant water resource challenges to
                     large segments of the population." ...Increases
                     in solar output break up oxygen molecules,
                     raising ozone concentrations in the upper
                     atmosphere. This adds to upper atmospheric
                     heating that leads to shifts in circulations
                     down to the surface. In turn, surface temperatures
                     warm, and the Earth's basic rainfall patterns
                     are enhanced. For instance, in wet regions
                     such as the tropics, precipitation usually
                     increases, while dry areas become more prone
                     to drought since rainfall decreases and
                     warmer temperatures help remove the small
                     amount of moisture in the soil. ...According
                     to the researchers, the same processes identified
                     by this new research very likely also affected
                     past civilizations, such as the Pueblo people
                     of New Mexico and Arizona who abandoned
                     cities in the 1300s.</span></p>

                     ...it was said in the 1990s that while the
                     available evidence of a serious human impact
                     on the earth's climate might be preponderant
                     enough to meet the legal test for liability
                     in a civil suit, it fell short of the more
                     stringent "beyond a reasonable doubt" test
                     of guilt in a criminal case. ...I've been
                     avidly watching from the sideline as the
                     strengthening evidence of climate change
                     has accumulated, not least the discovery
                     that the Greenland ice cap is melting faster
                     than had been thought. The implications
                     of that are enormous, though the speed with
                     which the melting may catastrophically raise
                     sea levels is uncertain - as are many aspects
                     of what a still hazily discerned climatic
                     future may hold. Last week, in its first
                     major report since 2001, the world's most
                     authoritative group of climate scientists
                     issued its strongest statement yet on the
                     relationship between global warming and
                     human activity. The Intergovernmental Panel
                     on Climate Change said the likelihood was
                     90 percent to 99 percent that emissions
                     of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon
                     dioxide, spewed from tailpipes and smokestacks,
                     were the dominant cause of the observed
                     warming of the last 50 years. In the panel's
                     parlance, this level of certainty is labeled "very
                     likely." ...Some experts believe that
                     no matter what humans do to try to rein
                     in greenhouse gas emissions, a doubling
                     is all but inevitable by 2100....</span></p>

                     Jere Lipps has an extraordinarily fine-grained
                     view of history. As a professor of paleontology
                     at UC Berkeley, Lipps examines records of
                     the past written in layers of sediments
                     and fossils. His work has shed light on
                     ancient earthquakes and extinction patterns,
                     the evolution of early life and even astrobiology,
                     and taken him to more than 160 countries
                     over the last 40 years. The common thread
                     to Lipps's far-ranging research? Foraminifera:
                     tiny marine creatures easily mistaken for
                     sand. Single-celled and quite separate from
                     animals, foraminifera live in virtually
                     every marine habitat explored by man. Even
                     among scientists, foraminifera are chiefly
                     known by their shells. These come in a galaxy
                     of forms-stars and coils, turbans and disks,
                     bulbous cones and simple tubes-segmented
                     into chambers and pierced by patterns of
                     pores....foraminifera may have evolved into
                     more than 80,000 species during their 545
                     million years on Earth. ...Recently, Lipps
                     and his international team used foraminifera
                     to analyze earthquake and tsunami frequency
                     around the Pacific Rim. ..."We estimate

                   over the horizon, no sound remained but the
                   howling of the Arctic wind. "It feels
                   a little like the days of the old explorers,
                   doesn't it?" Dennis Schmitt said. Mr.
                   Schmitt, a 60-year-old explorer from Berkeley,
                   Calif., had just landed on a newly revealed
                   island 400 miles north of the Arctic Circle
                   in eastern Greenland. ….Maps of the
                   region show a mountainous peninsula covered
                   with glaciers. …Now, where the maps
                   showed only ice, a band of fast-flowing seawater
                   ran between a newly exposed shoreline and
                   the aquamarine-blue walls of a retreating
                   ice shelf. The water was littered with dozens
                   of icebergs, some as large as half an acre;
                   every hour or so, several more tons of ice
                   fractured off the shelf with a thunderous
                   crack and an earth-shaking rumble. All over
                   Greenland and the Arctic, rising temperatures
                   are not simply melting ice; they are changing
                   the very geography of coastlines. Nunataks
                   - "lonely mountains" in Inuit -
                   that were encased in the margins of Greenland's
                   ice sheet are being freed of their age-old
                   bonds,… Arctic explorer Will Steger
                   said,"This phenomenon - of an island
                   all of a sudden appearing out of nowhere and
                   the ice melting around it - is a real common
                   phenomenon now."…..The sudden
                   appearance of the islands is a symptom of
                   an ice sheet going into retreat, scientists
                   say.…Tidewater glaciers, which discharge
                   ice into the oceans as they break up in the
                   process called calving, have doubled and tripled
                   in speed all over Greenland. Ice shelves are
                   breaking up, and summertime "glacial
                   earthquakes" have been detected within
                   the ice sheet…….Global warming
                   has profoundly altered the nature of polar
                   exploration, said Mr. Schmitt….</span></p>

                     said yesterday. ...The Arctic sea ice has
                     experienced sharp summertime retreats for

                     warming near the North Pole. (Neither melting
                     ice shelves nor sea ice contribute to rising
                     sea levels because they sit in the sea already,
                     like ice cubes in a drink.) Ninety percent
                     of the 3,900 square miles of ice shelves
                     that existed in 1906 when the Arctic explorer
                     Robert Peary first surveyed the region are

                     he said that it was a clear sign the warming
                     in the region was producing significant
                     and abrupt changes, and more were likely
                     in coming years. ...The age of the Ayles

                     NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     WASHINGTON, Dec. 27 - The Interior Department
                     proposed Wednesday to designate polar bears
                     as a threatened species, saying that the
                     accelerating loss of the Arctic ice that
                     is the bears' hunting platform has led biologists
                     to believe that bear populations will decline,
                     perhaps sharply, in the coming decades.
                     ... in a conference call with reporters,
                     Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said
                     that although his decision to seek protection
                     for polar bears acknowledged the melting
                     of the Arctic ice, his department was not
                     taking a position on why the ice was melting
                     or what to do about it. ...[he said] it
                     was not his department's job to assess causes
                     or prescribe solutions. ...The scientific
                     analysis in the proposal itself, however,
                     did assess the cause of melting ice. ...buildup
                     of heat-trapping gases was probably contributing
                     to the loss of sea ice to date or that the
                     continued buildup of these gases, left unchecked,
                     could create ice-free Arctic summers ...possibly
                     in as little as three decades. The Interior
                     Department ...must also work out a recovery
                     plan to control and reduce harmful impacts
                     to the species, usually by controlling the
                     activities that cause harm. It is unclear
                     whether such a recovery plan could avoid
                     addressing the link between manmade emissions
                     of heat-trapping gases and the increase
                     in Arctic temperatures. Kert Davies, the
                     research director for Greenpeace U.S.A.,
                     one of three environmental groups that sued
                     the Interior Department in 2005 to force
                     it to add polar bears to the list of threatened
                     species, said the administration was "clearly
                     scrambling for credibility of any kind in
                     this issue." Kassie Siegel, the lawyer
                     for the Center for Biological Diversity,
                     ...that took the lead in the lawsuit calling
                     on the department to list the polar bear,
                     added, "I don't see how even this administration
                     can write this proposal without acknowledging
                     that the primary threat to polar bears is
                     global warming and without acknowledging
                     the science of global warming." As
                     a result of the lawsuit, the Interior Department
                     had a court-ordered deadline of Wednesday
                     to make a decision. The worldwide population
                     of polar bears currently stands at 20,000
                     to 25,000, broken into 19 groups in Russia,
                     Denmark, Norway, Canada and the United States.
                     ...The most-studied bear population, in
                     the Western Hudson Bay in Canada, has dropped
                     22 percent, to 935 from 1,194 from 1987

                     Warming Poses Threat to Ski Resorts in the
                     Alps</a>. By MARK LANDLER, The New York
                     Times. KITZBYHEL, Austria. <span>Excerpt:
                     At the bottom of the Hahnenkamm, the famously
                     treacherous downhill course in this Austrian
                     ski resort, the slope peters out into a
                     grassy field...Snow cannons are showering
                     clouds of white crystals over the slopes,
                     but by midmorning each day, the machines
                     have to be turned off because the mercury
                     has risen too far for the fake snow to stick....
                     The record warmth - in some places autumn
                     temperatures were three degrees Celsius
                     above average - has brought home the profound
                     threat of climate change to Europe's ski
                     industry.... The Organization for Economic
                     Cooperation and Development, which sponsored
                     the second study, stopped short of predicting
                     ruin for Europe's ski industry. But Bruno
                     Abegg, a researcher at the University of
                     Zurich who was involved in it, said low-lying
                     resorts faced an insuperable problem...
                     He said, "I wouldn't invest in KitzbŸhel." Because
                     KitzbŸhel sits in a low Tyrolean valley,
                     at an altitude of only 2,624 feet, it is
                     viewed as particularly vulnerable to the
                     effects of global warming. For KitzbŸhel,
                     a glamorous dowager among Alpine resorts,
                     the only comfort in the warm spell is that
                     it has afflicted rivals at all altitudes.
                     Val d'Isare, in France, and St. Moritz,
                     in Switzerland - which are twice as high
                     - were forced to cancel recent World Cup
                     races for lack of snow.... A few guests
                     have canceled bookings for Christmas week,
                     according to the local tourism office. But
                     most are holding on to see if the weather
                     changes; snow is forecast for Sunday. If
                     it does not snow by New Year's Day, however,
                     people here say the trickle of cancellations
                     could turn into a flood. As for the broader
                     threat of global warming, townspeople react
                     with a mixture of fatalism and mild skepticism
                     to studies like the one coordinated by Austria's
                     Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics,
                     which says the Alps have not been this warm
                     since the eighth century..... Climatologists,
                     however, say the warming trend will become
                     dramatic by 2020. The new studies are alarming,
                     suggesting that the Alps are warming twice
                     as fast as the average in the rest of the
                     world. In 1980, 75 percent of Alpine glaciers
                     were advancing; now, 90 percent are retreating.
                     Reinhard Bšhm, a meteorologist who
                     worked on the study of Alpine temperatures,
                     said one explanation for the disparity was
                     the region's location in the middle of the
                     European continent, far from any oceans,
                     which react more moderately to global warming
                     trends......</span></p>

                     New studies project that the Arctic Ocean
                     could be mostly open water in summer by
                     2040 - several decades earlier than previously
                     expected - partly as a result of global
                     warming caused by emissions of greenhouse
                     gases....The projections come from computer
                     simulations of climate and ice and from
                     direct measurements showing that the amount
                     of ice coverage has been declining for 30
                     years. The latest modeling study, being
                     published on Tuesday in the journal Geophysical
                     Research Letters, was led by Marika Holland
                     of the National Center for Atmospheric Research
                     in Boulder, Colo....In the simulations,
                     the shift seems to occur when a pulse of

                     coverage was by far the lowest since satellite
                     measurements began in 1979, said Walt Meier,
                     a scientist at the ice center. "It's
                     becoming increasingly unlikely that things

                     global warming conditions." Several

                     -- as happened in northern Bhutan in 1994.
                     That year, a mile-long glacial lake named
                     Luggye Tsho, near Bhutan's border with Tibet,
                     ruptured catastrophically. Over a period
                     of several hours, the entire lake -- more
                     than a billion cubic feet of water -- emptied

                     NAIROBI, Kenya, Environment News Service
                     (ENS) - Birds are suffering the escalating
                     effects of climate change in every part
                     of the planet, finds a new report released
                     today by the global conservation group [World
                     Wildlife Fund] WWF at the United Nations
                     climate change conference in Nairobi. The
                     report reveals a trend towards a major bird
                     extinction due to global warming. The researchers
                     found declines of up to 90 percent in some
                     bird populations, as well as total and unprecedented
                     reproductive failure in others. They estimate
                     that bird extinction rates could be as high
                     as 38 percent in Europe, and 72 percent
                     in northeastern Australia, if global warming
                     exceeds two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial
                     levels - currently it is 0.8¼C above
                     those levels. "Robust scientific evidence
                     shows that climate change is now affecting
                     birds' behavior," said Dr. Karl Mallon,
                     scientific director at Climate Risk Pty.
                     Ltd of Sydney, Australia, authors of the
                     report. ..."We are seeing migratory
                     birds failing to migrate, and climate change
                     pushing increasing numbers of birds out
                     of synchrony with key elements of their
                     ecosystems," Mallon said. The report, "Bird
                     Species and Climate Change: The Global Status
                     Report," reviews more than 200 scientific
                     articles on birds in every continent to
                     build up a global picture of climate change
                     impacts. "Birds have long been used
                     as indicators of environmental change, and
                     with this report we see they are the quintessential
                     'canaries in the coal mine' when it comes
                     to climate change," said Hans Verolme,
                     director of WWF's Global Climate Change
                     Program. The report identifies groups of
                     birds at high risk from climate change -
                     migratory, mountain, island, and wetland
                     birds, Arctic and Antarctic birds, and seabirds.

                     KAMPALA - Climate change is melting a legendary
                     ice field in equatorial Africa and may soon
                     thaw it out completely, threatening fresh
                     water supplies to hundreds of thousands
                     of people, a climate expert said on Thursday.
                     The fabled, snow-capped Rwenzori mountains
                     -- dubbed the "Mountains of the Moon" in
                     travel brochures -- form part of the Uganda/Democratic
                     Republic of the Congo border and are one
                     of Uganda's top tourist destinations. But
                     warmer temperatures are melting the glaciers
                     sitting on their peaks, with some scientists
                     predicting the ice could be gone within
                     two to three decades. "Definitely,
                     the glaciers are decreasing," James
                     Magezi-Akiiki, a climate change specialist
                     at Uganda's environment ministry told Reuters. "They
                     have already decreased by 60 percent since
                     1910. If temperatures keep going up as they
                     have, there's a high chance of them disappearing." ..."The
                     same thing is happening to Kilimanjaro...
                     It's gone from white to brown," Magezi-Akiiki
                     said. A study in 2002 showed Kilimanjaro
                     to have lost more than 80 percent of its
                     ice cap in the past 100 years, reducing
                     water supplies to people living around it.
                     ...Glaciers are often a crucial store of
                     fresh water. "The streams originating
                     from the Rwenzori glaciers would disappear
                     if they melt," said Magezi-Akiiki. "And
                     during the dry season they are the only
                     source of water." ...</span></p>

                     carbon emissions are doing to the ocean.
                     ...In the nineteen-nineties, researchers
                     ... collected more than seventy thousand
                     seawater samples ... analysis of ...which
                     was completed in 2004, ... nearly half of
                     all the carbon dioxide that humans have
                     emitted ...has been absorbed by the sea.
                     ...carbonic acid ...can change the water's
                     pH. Already, humans have pumped enough carbon
                     into the oceans...to produce a .1 decline
                     in surface pH. Since pH ... is a logarithmic
                     measure, a .1 drop represents a rise in
                     acidity of about thirty per cent. The process
                     is ... "ocean acidification,"  ...
                     term coined in 2003 by two climate scientists,
                     Ken Caldeira and Michael Wickett, ...at
                     the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
                     ...Caldeira ...to brief some members of
                     Congress... was asked, 'What is the appropriate
                     stabilization target for atmospheric CO2?' " ... "And
                     I said, 'Well, I think it's inappropriate
                     to think in terms of stabilization targets.
                     I think we should think in terms of emissions
                     targets.' And they said, 'O.K., what's the
                     appropriate emissions target?' And I said,
                     'Zero.' "If you're talking about mugging
                     little old ladies, you don't say, 'What's
                     our target for the rate of mugging little
                     old ladies?' You say, 'Mugging little old
                     ladies is bad, and we're going to try to
                     eliminate it.' ...Coral reefs are under
                     threat.... When water temperatures rise
                     too high, corals lose...the algae that nourish
                     them. (The process is called "bleaching," because
                     without their zooxanthellae corals appear
                     white.) ...The seas have a built-in buffering
                     capacity: if the water's pH starts to drop,
                     shells and shell fragments that have been
                     deposited on the ocean floor begin to dissolve,
                     pushing the pH back up again. This buffering
                     mechanism is highly effective, provided
                     that acidification takes place on the same
                     timescale as deep-ocean circulation. (One
                     complete exchange of surface and bottom
                     water takes thousands of years.) ...Currently,
                     CO2 is being released into the air at least
                     three times and perhaps as much as thirty
                     times as quickly ...so fast that buffering
                     by ocean sediments is not even a factor....</span></p>

                     million people - have already been forced
                     to abandon their pastoral way of life because
                     of adverse climatic conditions. á During
                     the last drought, so many cattle, camels
                     and goats were lost that 60 per cent of
                     the families who remain as herders need
                     outside assistance to recover. Their surviving
                     herds are too small to support them. The
                     new findings follow recent warnings from
                     the UK Met Office that if current trends
                     continue one-third of the planet will be
                     desert by the end of 2100. The scientists
                     modelled how drought is likely to increase
                     globally during the coming century because
                     of predicted changes in rainfall and temperature
                     around the world....</span></p>

                     A new ice-core record from Antarctica provides
                     the best evidence yet of a link between
                     climate in the northern and southern polar
                     regions that operates through changes in
                     ocean circulation. Excerpt: Over the past
                     20 years, the analysis of ice cores has
                     been transforming our understanding of past
                     climate. Most notably, the Vostok core from
                     Antarctica provided remarkable evidence
                     of the correspondence between temperature
                     and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
                     over the past 420,000 years. And the GISP2,
                     GRIP and NGRIP cores from Greenland offered
                     a view in unprecedented detail of climate
                     change over the past 100,000 years (including
                     the revelation that abrupt warming events
                     of 10 ¡C or more have taken place
                     in Greenland). More recently, the European
                     Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA)
                     obtained the longest ice-core record yet,
                     one spanning 800,000 years of climate history,

                     suffers worst drought in 1,000 years</a>.
                     John Vidal, environment editor, The Guardian. <span>Excerpt:
                     Depleted reservoirs, failed crops and arid
                     farmland spark global warming tussle. Australia's
                     blistering summer has only just begun but
                     reservoir levels are dropping fast, crop
                     forecasts have been slashed, and great swaths
                     of the continent are entering what scientists
                     yesterday called a "one in a thousand
                     years drought". With many regions in
                     their fifth year of drought, the government
                     yesterday called an emergency water summit
                     in Canberra. ...The drought is likely to
                     affect drinking water supplies to many areas.
                     ...It is also expected to have a serious
                     impact on crops. Last week, the government
                     forecast its lowest wheat crop for 12 years,
                     a 62% decrease on last year. ...The drought
                     has set off a fierce political debate in
                     Australia about climate change. The country
                     has maintained, with the US, a sceptical
                     stance on the issue, and Mr Howard has refused
                     to sign Australia up to the Kyoto agreement.
                     However, polls suggest he is increasingly
                     out of step with public and scientific opinion
                     and the drought has forced him to demonstrate
                     concern. ...Australia now emits almost as
                     much carbon and other greenhouse gases as
                     France and Italy, which each have three
                     times its population. ...South Australia's
                     premier, Mike Rann, said yesterday: "What
                     we're seeing with this drought is a frightening
                     glimpse of the future with global warming."<br />
                     But Mr Howard played down the assessment
                     that the drought was the worst in 1,000
                     years, saying he doubted if anybody really
                     knew.</span></p>

                     GENEVA, Switzerland, Environment News Service
                     (ENS) - Survival strategies for coral reefs
                     and mangroves threatened by climate change
                     are outlined by scientists of IUCN-World
                     Conservation Union and the Nature Conservancy
                     in two new publications launched today.
                     The strategies rely on managing stressors
                     other than global warming so that corals
                     and mangroves are more resilient and able
                     to survive in a warming world. Climate change
                     is destroying tropical marine ecosystems
                     through sea temperature increase and ocean
                     acidification. Scientists say 20 percent
                     of the world's coral reefs have already
                     been ruined and a further 50 percent are
                     facing immediate or long term danger of
                     collapse. Yet, one of the reports published
                     today shows that saving the world's coral
                     reefs may still be possible. By fighting
                     other stress factors such as pollution or
                     overfishing impacting coral reefs, the reefs
                     will be able to better adapt to climate
                     change impacts, according to the report, "Coral
                     Reef Resilience and Resistance to Bleaching." ...Coral
                     reefs only cover 0.2 percent of the ocean
                     floor, but contain 25 percent of marine
                     species globally. Coral reefs provide livelihoods
                     to 100 million people and provide the basis
                     for industries such as tourism and fishing,
                     worth an annual net benefit of US$30 billion,
                     the report states. One hectare of mangroves
                     is estimated to deliver products and services
                     worth up to $900,000. Examples of these
                     products and services include timber and
                     wood chips, an environment for fish spawning,
                     and habitat for economically important species.

                     Insects have proven to be highly adaptable
                     organisms, able through evolution to cope
                     with a variety of environmental changes,
                     including relatively recent changes in the
                     world's climate. But like something out
                     of a scary Halloween tale, new University
                     of Washington research suggests insects'
                     ability to adapt to warmer temperatures
                     carries an unexpected consequence - more
                     insects. It appears that insect species
                     that adapt to warmer climates also will
                     increase their maximum rates of population
                     growth, which UW researchers say is likely
                     to have widespread affects on agriculture,
                     public health and conservation. ..."Enhanced
                     population growth rates for butterflies
                     might be a good thing, but enhanced growth
                     rates for mosquito populations is much more
                     dubious," said Frazier, who is lead
                     author of the new research, published in
                     the October edition of the journal The American

                     the National Cancer Institute. ...biochemical
                     adaptation to warmer temperature is not
                     the only possible insect response to climate
                     warming. Some species might evade warmer
                     temperatures by moving to cooler habitats,
                     or they might alter their seasonal activity
                     patterns. Others might not be able to adapt
                     adequately and could become extinct. But
                     those that do adapt should have elevated
                     rates of population growth. "No matter
                     which scenario plays out for a given species,
                     local ecosystems will be profoundly altered," Frazier

                     Century of Drought</a>.<span> Excerpt:
                     Leading climatologists in Britain recently
                     predicted that global warming would result
                     in extensive drought over the next century.
                     The droughts, which are predicted to affect
                     one third of the earth's land mass, will
                     likely devastate developing countries that
                     already struggle to meet their populaces'
                     needs for food, safe sanitation and water.
                     Some say that this forecast may underestimate
                     the severity of the drought as it does not
                     take into account the effects of changes
                     to the carbon cycle resulting from global
                     warming. The full study, produced by the
                     Hadley Centre, will be published later in

                     Warming on the Forest Floor</a>. By HENRY
                     FOUNTAIN, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     Along with rising temperatures, global warming
                     is very likely to cause a shift toward more
                     extreme weather -- stronger storms with
                     more rainfall, and longer and more severe
                     droughts. Those changes are likely to have
                     large-scale, obvious effects on farmlands,
                     grasslands and forests and on the creatures
                     that inhabit them. ... Researchers at the
                     University of Kentucky looked at ...the
                     impact of climate change on the decomposition
                     of leaf litter on the forest floor. The
                     researchers, Janet R. Lensing and David
                     H. Wise, studied the process of leaf decay
                     in hardwood forests in central Kentucky.
                     The main instigator in leaf decay is fungi,
                     which get nutrients from the organic matter.
                     But fungi don't exist in a vacuum. They
                     are grazed upon by springtails, primitive
                     insects of the Collembola order. In turn,
                     springtails are the prey of wandering spiders.
                     The who-eats-whom makes for a complex web,
                     where changes at one level can have cascading
                     effects. Too much or too little grazing
                     by springtails, for example, can reduce
                     fungal activity and slow decay. ...They
                     didn't see much change in leaf decomposition
                     under higher-rainfall conditions. But under
                     drought conditions, they found, decay accelerated
                     significantly. ...''Our hypothesis is that
                     during drought conditions, the fungi are
                     already drought-stressed, and the Collembola
                     are overgrazing them, which slows down decay,''
                     Dr. Lensing said. Under these circumstances,
                     by preying on the springtails, the spiders
                     reduce the pressure on the fungi, thus allowing
                     for more leaf decay. Under wetter conditions
                     the fungi are not so stressed and so easily
                     overgrazed, so spider predation on springtails
                     has less effect.<br />
                     It's not that the dryness has a direct influence
                     on populations of spiders, say, or springtails.
                     Instead, Dr. Lensing said, ''it affects
                     how the cascading occurs'' within the food
                     web. This indirect impact on leaf decay,
                     she added, ''shows how complex the effect
                     of altered rainfall can be.''</span></p>

                     OCEAN COOLING SUGGESTS GLOBAL WARMING 'SPEED
                     BUMP'</a><span>. Excerpt:
                     The average temperature of the water near
                     the top of the Earth's oceans has significantly
                     cooled since 2003. New research suggests
                     global warming trends are not always steady
                     in their effects on ocean temperatures.
                     Although the average temperature of the
                     upper oceans has significantly cooled since
                     2003, the decline is a fraction of the total
                     ocean warming over the previous 48 years. "This
                     research suggests global warming isn't always
                     steady, but happens with occasional 'speed
                     bumps'," said Josh Willis, a co-author
                     of the study at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
                     Pasadena, Calif. ...Willis said the findings
                     have significant implications for global
                     sea-level rise. "Average sea level
                     goes up partly due to warming and thermal
                     expansion of the oceans and partly due to
                     runoff from melting glaciers and ice sheets," Willis
                     said. "The recent cooling episode suggests
                     sea level should have actually decreased
                     in the past two years. Despite this, sea
                     level has continued to rise. This may mean
                     that sea level rise has recently shifted
                     from being mostly caused by warming to being
                     dominated by melting. This idea is consistent
                     with recent estimates of ice-mass loss in
                     Antarctica and accelerating ice-mass loss
                     on Greenland," he said. ...the cause
                     of the recent cooling is not yet clear.
                     Research suggests it may be due to a net
                     loss of heat from the Earth. "Further
                     work will be necessary to solve this cooling
                     mystery...." NASA RELEASE: 06-318.</span></p>

                     of Old World fruit flies on three continents
                     mirrors climate change.</a> <span>University
                     of Washington News. Fast-warming climate
                     appears to be triggering genetic changes
                     in a species of fruit fly that is native
                     to Europe and was introduced into North
                     and South America about 25 years ago. "This
                     is a clear signal on three different continents
                     that climate change is occurring, and that
                     genetic change is going along with it," said
                     Raymond Huey, a University of Washington
                     biology professor who is co-author of a
                     paper describing the findings, published
                     Aug. 31 in Science Express, the online edition
                     of the journal Science. The research deals
                     with an Old World fruit fly species called
                     Drosophila subobscura, which originally
                     ranged from the Mediterranean Sea to Scandinavia.
                     ...The fruit flies were accidentally introduced
                     to the Pacific Coast of Chile in the late
                     1970s and to the North American West Coast
                     in the early 1980s, probably on cargo ships.
                     They spread rapidly, and in North America
                     they are now found from near Santa Barbara,
                     Calif., to northern Vancouver Island in
                     British Columbia.<br />
                     ...In the paper, the researchers note that "the
                     genetic shift is remarkably rapid and is
                     detectable even for samples separated by
                     fewer than two decades." They add that
                     such rapid genetic changes are likely to
                     occur much more quickly in organisms with
                     short life spans, such as a fruit fly, which
                     can produce several generations in a single
                     year. "In the long term, this suggests
                     that climate warming is already having genetic
                     effects, at least on these organisms," Huey
                     said.</span></p>

                     Respond to Philip M. Boffey's 'The Evidence
                     for Global Warming'</a>. NY Times - TIMESSELECT
                     - <span>Excerpt: Ralph
                     Deeds, Birmingham, Mich.: It appears to
                     me that the politics of global warming is
                     more difficult than the science. For example,
                     existing automobile technology could produce
                     a huge savings in oil if our Congress would
                     stop debating flag burning and pass legislation
                     to encourage more fuel-efficient motor vehicles.
                     This could easily be done by gradually increasing
                     the gasoline tax to bring pump prices up
                     to European levels. ....<br />
                     ...Eugene I. Gordon, Mountainside, N.J.:
                     The article makes a convincing case that
                     we are experiencing global warming. I won't
                     attempt to debate that conclusion because
                     I believe it. However, the article is incredibly
                     one-sided concerning the cause of the current
                     global warming. Mr. Boffey mentions the
                     cooling experienced during a minor ice age
                     a few hundred years ago but neglects to
                     mention that it was accompanied by a virtual
                     disappearance of the 11 year sunspot cycle,
                     the Maunder Minimum. It is known that high
                     sunspot activity increases the thermal flux
                     incident on the Earth from solar radiation
                     and high energy particles. Currently we
                     are experiencing a maximum in sunspot activity
                     that virtually perfectly parallels the increasing
                     global temperature average including up
                     and down variations. Fortunately, the sunspot
                     activity has begun to decrease and we should
                     get relief independent of what else we do.<br />
                     In addition, Mr. Boffey completely ignores
                     the fact that the dominant greenhouse gas
                     is water vapor, which is 50 times more complicit
                     in retaining IR [infrared] radiation than
                     carbon dioxide. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide
                     plays but a tiny role in the total greenhouse
                     gas picture. Were it not for water vapor,
                     the average temperature of the earth would
                     be about 0 degrees Fahrenheit rather than
                     58 and there would be virtually no life
                     on Earth. We should be glad for the water
                     vapor and not worry so much about carbon
                     dioxide....Mr. Boffey disparages oil interests
                     without examining the interests of the scientific
                     community that reaches a consensus while
                     ignoring basic physics and the record.</span></p>

                     NEW SMYRNA BEACH, Fla.</span> <span>When
                     scientists consider the possible effects
                     of global warming, there is a lot they don't
                     know. But they can say one thing for sure:
                     sea levels will rise. ...This rising water
                     will be felt along the artificially maintained
                     beaches of New Jersey, in the vanishing
                     marshes of Louisiana, even on the ocean
                     bluffs of California. According to a 2000
                     report by the Heinz Center for Science,
                     Economics and the Environment, at least
                     a quarter of the houses within 500 feet
                     of the United States coast may be lost to
                     rising seas by 2060. There were 350,000
                     of these houses when the report was written,
                     but today there are far more. ...Some of
                     the rise - scientists argue over how much
                     - is because of natural variation, like
                     changes in atmospheric pressures and winds
                     over the Southern Ocean. But much of it
                     results from warming; as water warms, it
                     expands, occupying more space. Also, warming
                     melts inland glaciers and ice sheets, sending
                     torrents of fresh water into the oceans.
                     In 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on
                     Climate Change, convened by the United Nations,
                     said that the rise in sea levels was accelerating.
                     Their mid-range projection for 2100 was
                     a rise of just under 20 inches from a 1990
                     baseline, partly because of this melting.
                     Evidence reported since then suggests that
                     the rise may be even faster. (If ice sheets
                     on Greenland and Antarctica melt significantly,
                     seas will rise by 20 feet or more, but few
                     scientists expect that to happen in this
                     century.) ...much of Florida is so low that
                     a one-foot rise in sea level would send
                     water 100 feet inland. Dr. Howd, 49, who
                     lives in St. Petersburg, said that is one
                     reason he does not expect to retire there.
                     His house is about 600 feet from the beach,
                     but only about 6 feet above sea level....</span></p>

                     can precisely control the concentration
                     of carbon dioxide in the air. Duke researchers
                     discovered that when exposed to higher levels
                     of CO2, the greenhouse gas released in ever-increasing
                     quantities from human activity, poison ivy

                     The researchers found that the weedlike
                     plant grew much faster under CO2 conditions
                     similar to those projected for the middle
                     of the century. The plant also produced
                     a more noxious form of its rash-causing
                     chemical: a more poisonous poison ivy.<br />
                     ...Poison ivy isn't the only plant whose
                     growth is encouraged by additional carbon
                     dioxide. In the Duke experiments, Dr. Schlesinger
                     said, the trees themselves show an increase
                     in growth under carbon dioxide concentrations
                     roughly 50 percent higher than current conditions.

                     that offers detail its authors call "an
                     unprecedented picture of climate change." The
                     decline in winter snowpack means less spring
                     and summer runoff from snowmelt. That translates
                     to unprecedented pressure on people worldwide

                     famous snows of Mt. Kilimanjaro will be
                     gone within decades, and on Greenland signs

                     due to global warming, the country's official
                     Xinhua News Agency said. Xinhua said the
                     figure is drawn from data from China's 681
                     weather stations over four decades. Statistics
                     from the Tibet weather bureau show that
                     average temperatures in Tibet have risen
                     by 0.9 degree Celsius (2 Fahrenheit) since
                     the 1980s, Xinhua reported, quoting Han
                     Yongxiang of the National Meteorological
                     Bureau. ...The melting glaciers will eventually
                     lead to drought, more desertification and
                     an increase in the number of sandstorms,
                     Xinhua quoted researcher Dong Guangrong
                     at the Chinese Academy of Sciences as saying.
                     ...The severity of China's sandstorms was
                     highlighted by the onslaught of 300,000
                     metric tons (330,000 short tons) of dust
                     in capital Beijing two weeks ago. ...Workers
                     have already planted thousands of acres
                     of vegetation to stop the spread of deserts

                     loss of ice from Greenland doubled between
                     1996 and 2005, as its glaciers flowed faster
                     into the ocean in response to a generally
                     warmer climate, according to a NASA/University
                     of Kansas study. ...The evolution of Greenland's
                     ice sheet is being driven by ... accumulation
                     of snow in its interior, which adds mass
                     and lowers sea level; melting of ice along
                     its edges, which decreases mass and raises
                     sea level; and the flow of ice into the
                     sea from outlet glaciers along its edges,
                     which also decreases mass and raises sea
                     level. ...From 1996 to 2000, widespread
                     glacial acceleration was found at latitudes
                     below 66 degrees north. This acceleration
                     extended to 70 degrees north by 2005. The
                     researchers estimated the ice mass loss
                     resulting from enhanced glacier flow increased
                     from 63 cubic kilometers in 1996 to 162
                     cubic kilometers in 2005. Combined with
                     the increase in ice melt and in snow accumulation
                     over that same time period, they determined
                     the total ice loss from the ice sheet increased
                     from 96 cubic kilometers in 1996 to 220
                     cubic kilometers in 2005. To put this into
                     perspective, a cubic kilometer is one trillion
                     liters (approximately 264 billion gallons
                     of water), about a quarter more than Los
                     Angeles uses in one year. ...For University

                     A week after NASA's top climate scientist
                     complained that the space agency's public-affairs
                     office was trying to silence his statements
                     on global warming, the agency's administrator,
                     Michael D. Griffin, issued a sharply worded
                     statement yesterday calling for "scientific
                     openness" throughout the agency."It
                     is not the job of public-affairs officers," 
                     Dr. Griffin wrote in an e-mail message to
                     the agency's 19,000 employees, "to
                     alter, filter or adjust engineering or scientific
                     material produced by NASA's technical staff." The
                     statement came six days after The New York
                     Times quoted the scientist, James E. Hansen,
                     as saying he was threatened with "dire
                     consequences" if he continued to call
                     for prompt action to limit emissions of
                     heat-trapping gases linked to global warming...In
                     October, for example, George Deutsch, a
                     presidential appointee in NASA headquarters,
                     told a Web designer working for the agency
                     to add the word "theory" after
                     every mention of the Big Bang, according
                     to an e-mail message from Mr. Deutsch that
                     another NASA employee forwarded to The Times.

                     The top climate scientist at NASA says the
                     Bush administration has tried to stop him
                     from speaking out since he gave a lecture
                     last month calling for prompt reductions
                     in emissions of greenhouse gases linked
                     to global warming. The scientist, James
                     E. Hansen, longtime director of the agency's
                     Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said
                     in an interview that officials at NASA headquarters
                     had ordered the public affairs staff to
                     review his coming lectures, papers, postings
                     on the Goddard Web site and requests for
                     interviews from journalists. Dr. Hansen
                     said he would ignore the restrictions. "They
                     feel their job is to be this censor of information

                     several interviews with The New York Times
                     in recent days, Dr. Hansen said it would
                     be irresponsible not to speak out, particularly
                     because NASA's mission statement includes
                     the phrase

                     New Warming</a>. By ANDREW C. REVKIN. <span>Excerpt:
                     Earth scientists with the longest frames
                     of reference...often seem to be the least
                     agitated about human-caused global warming
                     ... even in 2005, a year that saw the biggest
                     summer retreat of Arctic sea ice ever measured...
                     and global temperatures continuing a sharp
                     climb that began around 1990 and appears
                     unmatched in 2,000 years. But these backward-looking
                     experts have seen it all before. ... 49
                     million years ago the balmy Arctic Ocean,
                     instead of being covered in ice, was matted
                     with a cousin of the duckweed that cloaks
                     suburban frog ponds. The forests on the
                     continent now called Antarctica and on shores
                     fringing the Arctic were once thick and
                     lush. And through hundreds of millions of
                     years, concentrations of carbon dioxide
                     and the other trace gases that trap solar
                     energy and prevent the planet from being
                     an ice ball have mostly been far higher
                     than those typical during humankind's short
                     existence. ...the planet has nothing to
                     worry about from global warming. A hot,
                     steamy earth would be fine for most forms
                     of life. Earth and its biological veneer
                     are far more resilient than human societies,
                     particularly those still mired in poverty
                     or pushed to the margins of the livable...
                     and species like polar bears that, like
                     the poorest people, are pushed to an edge
                     - in the bear's case the tenuous ecosystem
                     built around coastal sea ice. ...Studies
                     of the past also show that pace matters.
                     The rise in temperature and greenhouse gases
                     during the great heat wave 55 million years
                     ago, while instantaneous on a geological
                     time scale, took thousands of years to unfold.
                     But the pace of the recent rise in carbon
                     dioxide is as much as 200 times as fast
                     as what has been estimated in past rapid
                     climate transitions. ...Even for polar bears,
                     there are reasons to think the end is not
                     necessarily nigh. There was at least one
                     significant period - the last gap between
                     ice ages 120,000 years ago - when the global
                     climate was several degrees warmer than
                     it is today and they clearly squeaked through.
                     So at least slowing or blunting the warming
                     might allow them to squeak through once
                     again...</span>

                     Drought Cripples Life Along the Amazon</a>.
                     By LARRY ROHTER. NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     MANAQUIRI, Brazil - The Amazon River basin,
                     the world's largest rain forest, is grappling
                     with a devastating drought that in some
                     areas is the worst since record keeping
                     began a century ago. It has evaporated whole
                     lagoons and kindled forest fires, killed
                     off fish and crops, stranded boats and the
                     villagers who travel by them, brought disease
                     and wreaked economic havoc. ..."There
                     have been years before in which we've had
                     a deficit of rainfall, but we've never experienced
                     drops in the water levels of rivers like
                     those we have seen in 2005," said Everaldo
                     Souza, a meteorologist at the Amazon Protection
                     System ...They also worry that if global
                     warming is involved, as some of them suspect,
                     it may be the beginning of a new era of
                     more severe and frequent droughts in the
                     region that accounts for nearly a quarter
                     of the world's fresh water. "The Amazon
                     is a kind of canary-in-a-coal-mine situation," said
                     Daniel C. Nepstad, a senior scientist at
                     the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts
                     and the Amazon Institute of Ecological Research
                     in Belém. "We have no idea of
                     the game we have played into by running
                     this worldwide experiment of pumping so
                     much greenhouse gases into the atmosphere," Mr.
                     Nepstad said....Even as the drought begins
                     to subside, scientists are still debating
                     what caused it. The explanation accepted
                     most widely pins primary responsibility
                     on higher water temperatures in tropical
                     regions of the Atlantic Ocean, the same
                     phenomenon being blamed for the increase
                     in the number of hurricanes forming in the
                     Northern Hemisphere this year. "A warmer
                     Atlantic not only helps give more energy
                     to hurricanes, it also aids in evaporating
                     air," said Luiz Gylvan Meira, a climate
                     specialist at the Institute for Advanced
                     Studies at the University of São
                     Paulo. "But when that air rises over
                     the oceans in one region, it eventually
                     has to come down somewhere else, thousands
                     of miles away. In this case, it came down
                     in the western Amazon, blocking the formation
                     of clouds that would bring rain to the headwaters
                     of the rivers that feed the Amazon."...While
                     scientists largely agree that higher temperatures
                     in the Atlantic are responsible for the
                     severity of this year's drought, they are
                     still searching for an explanation for that
                     phenomenon. It could be just a one-time
                     disturbance, or it could be more permanent,
                     perhaps brought on by greenhouse gas emissions. "Yes,
                     a global warming effect would explain increases
                     in ocean temperatures, but no one is saying
                     that yet, because it is still very early,
                     and we don't yet have enough data," said
                     Carlos Nobre, director of Brazil's National
                     Institute of Space Research, which monitors
                     climatic patterns in the Amazon. "Droughts
                     like this one are very rare, but one consequence
                     of a warmer planet would be that they occur
                     with more frequency, which is something
                     we are going to have to be watching for." </span>

                     In 1969 Roy Koerner, a Canadian government
                     glaciologist, was one of four men (and 36
                     dogs) who completed the first surface crossing
                     of the Arctic Ocean, from Alaska through
                     the North Pole to Norway. Now, he said,
                     such a trek would be impossible: there is
                     just not enough ice. In September, the area
                     covered by sea ice reached a record low. "I
                     look on it as a different world," 
                            Dr. Koerner said. "I recently
                            reviewed a proposal by one guy to
                            go across by kayak."... Many
                            scientists say it has taken a long
                            time for them to accept that global
                            warming, partly the result of carbon
                            dioxide and other heat-trapping gases
                            in the atmosphere, could shrink the
                            Arctic's summer cloak of ice. But
                            many of those same scientists have
                            concluded that the momentum behind
                            human-caused warming, combined with
                            the region's tendency to amplify
                            change, has put the familiar Arctic
                            past the point of no return.</span>

                     CHURCHILL, Manitoba - It seems harsh to
                     say that bad news for polar bears is good
                     for Pat Broe. Mr. Broe, a Denver entrepreneur,
                     is no more to blame than anyone else for
                     a meltdown at the top of the world that
                     threatens Arctic mammals and ancient traditions
                     and lends credibility to dark visions of
                     global warming. ...Still, the newest study
                     of the Arctic ice cap - finding that it
                     faded this summer to its smallest size ever
                     recorded - is beginning to make Mr. Broe
                     look like a visionary for buying this derelict
                     Hudson Bay port from the Canadian government
                     in 1997. Especially at the price he paid:
                     about $7. By Mr. Broe's calculations, Churchill
                     could bring in as much as $100 million a
                     year as a port on Arctic shipping lanes
                     shorter by thousands of miles than routes
                     to the south, and traffic would only increase
                     as the retreat of ice in the region clears
                     the way for a longer shipping season. With
                     major companies and nations large and small
                     adopting similar logic, the Arctic is undergoing
                     nothing less than a great rush for virgin
                     territory and natural resources worth hundreds
                     of billions of dollars. ... All told, one
                     quarter of the world's undiscovered oil
                     and gas resources lies in the Arctic, according
                     to the United States Geological Survey.
                     The polar thaw is also starting to unlock
                     other treasures: lucrative shipping routes,
                     perhaps even the storied Northwest Passage;
                     new cruise ship destinations; and important
                     commercial fisheries.</span>

                     The floating cap of sea ice on the Arctic
                     Ocean shrank this summer to what is probably
                     its smallest size in at least a century
                     of record keeping... a team of climate experts
                     reported yesterday. That shift is hard to
                     explain without attributing it in part to
                     human-caused global warming, the team's
                     members and other experts on the region
                     said. The change also appears to be headed
                     toward becoming self-sustaining: the increased
                     open water absorbs solar energy that would
                     otherwise be reflected back into space by
                     bright white ice, said Ted A. Scambos, a
                     scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data
                     Center in Boulder, Colo. ...The data was
                     released on the center's Web site, <a href="http://www.nsidc.org/" target="_blank">http://www.nsidc.org</a>.
                     ...One of the most important consequences
                     of Arctic warming will be increased flows
                     of meltwater and icebergs from glaciers
                     and ice sheets, and thus an accelerated
                     rise in sea levels, threatening coastal
                     areas. The loss of sea ice could also hurt
                     both polar bears and Eskimo seal hunters.
                     ...Other experts on Arctic ice and climate
                     disagreed on details. For example, Ignatius
                     G. Rigor at the University of Washington
                     said the change was probably linked to a
                     mix of factors, including influences of
                     the atmospheric cycle. But he agreed with
                     Dr. Serreze that the influence from greenhouse
                     gases had to be involved. ...Other experts
                     expressed some caution. Claire L. Parkinson,
                     a sea ice expert at NASA's Goddard Space
                     Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said a
                     host of changes in the Arctic - including
                     rising temperatures, melting permafrost
                     and shrinking sea ice - were consistent
                     with human-caused warming. But she emphasized
                     that the complicated system was still far
                     from completely understood. </span>

                     with the power of Hurricane Katrina are
                     becoming more common, in part because of
                     global warming, according to a report from
                     a team of researchers that will be published
                     Friday. The number of storms in the two
                     most powerful categories, 4 and 5, rose
                     to an average of 18 a year worldwide since
                     1990, up from 11 in the 1970's.... The researchers
                     were led by Peter J. Webster of the Georgia
                     Institute of Technology. There was no increase
                     in storms over all, the researchers said,
                     just in their intensity. But the rise in
                     intensity, they said, coincided with an
                     increase of nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit in
                     the surfaces of tropical seas around the
                     world.... Not all scientists were convinced
                     by the findings. Some said the changes in
                     storms are part of natural variability.
                     Christopher Landsea, a meteorologist at
                     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
                     questioned the data showing an increase
                     in major storms, saying the estimates of
                     the wind speeds in storms in the 1970's
                     might not be accurate....</span></p>

                     and weather-balloon research released Friday
                     removes a last bastion of scientific doubt
                     about global warming, researchers say. Surface
                     temperatures have shown small but steady
                     increases since the 1970s, but the tropics
                     had shown little atmospheric heating - and
                     even some cooling. Now, after sleuthing
                     reported in three papers released by the
                     journal Science, revisions have been made
                     to that atmospheric data. Climate expert
                     Ben Santer of Lawrence Livermore National
                     Laboratory in California, lead author of
                     one of the papers, says that those fairly
                     steady measurements in the tropics have
                     been a key argument "among people asking,
                     'Why should I believe this global warming
                     hocus-pocus?' " 
                     After examining the satellite data, collected
                     since 1979 by National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                     Administration weather satellites, Carl
                     Mears and Frank Wentz of Remote Sensing
                     Systems in Santa Rosa, Calif., found that
                     the satellites had drifted in orbit, throwing
                     off the timing of temperature measures.
                     Essentially, the satellites were increasingly
                     reporting nighttime temperatures as daytime
                     ones, leading to a false cooling trend.</span></p>

                     continent, there is a simple calculus, said

                     "When the rains fail, people die." ...One
                     new study bodes particularly poorly for
                     southern Africa, indicating that a 50-year-long
                     drying trend there is likely to continue
                     and appears tightly linked to substantial
                     warming of the Indian Ocean. The authors
                     of the study say that the heating of that
                     ocean, which lacks the natural variability
                     of the Pacific and Atlantic, is one of the
                     clearest fingerprints pointing to human-caused
                     climate change. "In our models, the
                     Indian Ocean shows very clear and dramatic
                     warming into the future, which means more
                     and more drought for southern Africa,"

                   combustion, may have a significant warming
                   impact on the Arctic," 
                       Koch said. "Further, it means there
                       may be immediate consequences for Arctic
                       ecosystems, and potentially long-term
                       implications on climate patterns for much
                       of the globe," she added. The Arctic
                       is especially susceptible to the impact
                       of human-generated particles and other
                       pollution. In recent years the Arctic
                       has significantly warmed, and sea-ice
                       cover and glacial snow have diminished.
                       Likely causes for these trends include
                       changing weather patterns and the effects
                       of pollution. Black carbon has been implicated
                       as playing a role in melting ice and snow.
                       When soot falls on ice, it darkens the
                       surface and accelerates melting by increasing
                       absorbed sunlight. Airborne soot also
                       warms the air and affects weather patterns
                       and clouds. ...For more information and

                     Turns to Future to Rescue Its Past</a>.
                     By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL, International Herald
                     Tribune. <span>VENICE
                     - When Jane da Mosto scrambles from the
                     water taxi onto the front steps of her family's
                     ancient palazzo on the Grand Canal, her
                     gaze is tinged with mourning. The once glorious
                     Casa da Mosto is now little more than a
                     decaying, waterlogged shell of a building,
                     the rising and increasingly salty water
                     of Venice lapping at the door and eating
                     away at its walls.<br />
"One day it will just fall into the canal," 
                            said Ms. da Mosto, a researcher with
                            Corila, a consortium of groups studying
                            the Venice lagoon in hopes of saving
                            it.... From an evolutionary standpoint,
                            Venice's decline is perhaps inevitable.
                            Lagoons, with their marshes and brackish
                            waters, are transitional coastal
                            ecosystems, tending to become freshwater
                            lakes or to blend in with the adjacent
                            sea over time. That process accelerates
                            when man cohabits with this unstable
                            bit of nature, as he has here for
                            well over 1,000 years.... But the
                            rapid changes in the ecosystem have
                            occurred with modernization in the
                            20th century. Starting in the 1930's,
                            an industrial zone and other lands
                            were created by pumping groundwater
                            out of the marsh, seriously accelerating
                            sinkage. Shipping and pollution that
                            followed eroded many of the crucial
                            defensive features of the lagoon
                            that for centuries helped to keep
                            the sea at bay.... Global warming
                            has not yet contributed substantially
                            to rising water levels here, Ms.
                            da Mosto said. Predictions of the
                            phenomenon's eventual effect on the
                            Adriatic vary widely: some scientists
                            estimate a rise due to global warming
                            of just three inches and others suggest
                          the change may be nearly a yard....</span></p>

                     parcel of studies looking at the oceans
                     and melting Arctic ice leave no room for
                     doubt that it is getting warmer, people
                     are to blame, and the weather is going to
                     suffer, climate experts said on Thursday.
                     New computer models that look at ocean temperatures
                     instead of the atmosphere show the clearest
                     signal yet that global warming is well underway,
                     said Tim Barnett of the Scripps Institution
                     of Oceanography. ...The report was published
                     one day after the United Nations Kyoto Protocol
                     took effect, a 141-nation environmental
                     pact the United States government has spurned
                     for several reasons, including stated doubts
                     about whether global warming is occurring
                     and is caused by people. Barnett urged U.S.
                     officials to reconsider...."The debate
                     is what are we going to do about it." ...Ruth
                     Curry of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
                     found that melting ice was changing the
                     water cycle, which in turn affects ocean
                     currents and, ultimately, climate. "As
                     the Earth warms, its water cycle is changing,
                     being pushed out of kilter," she said. "Ice

                     up, it's easy to spot the clouds. The white
                     fluff is strikingly contrasted by the blue
                     sky. It's not so easy from space, especially
                     above the Earth's poles. The clouds blend
                     in against the vast expanses of snow and

                     haze particles are not cooling the Earth as
                     much as previously thought. These findings have
                     implications for the ability to predict changes
                     in climate. Andrew Ackerman, a scientist at
                     NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field,
                     Calif., and his colleagues found, when the air
                     over clouds is dry, polluted clouds hold less
                     water and reflect less solar energy. ... Low
                     clouds cool the planet by reflecting sunlight
                     away from the Earth's surface, and more water
                     makes a cloud more reflective. Previously, scientific
                     consensus was, since polluted clouds precipitate
                     less, they should contain more water and reflect
                     more sunlight back into space. Most predictions
                     of global climate change assume less precipitation
                     will result in clouds holding more water, reflecting
                     more sunlight and counteracting greenhouse warming.
                     ... The measurements show cloud water decreases
                     more often than it increases in polluted clouds. </span>

                   Goddard Space Flight Center. When people talk
                   about something moving at a glacial pace,
                   they are referring to speeds that make a tortoise
                   look like a hare. ... researchers who study
                   Earth's ice and the flow of glaciers have
                   been surprised to find the world's fastest
                   glacier in Greenland doubled its speed between
                   1997 and 2003. ... The finding is important
                   for many reasons. For starters, as more ice
                   moves from glaciers on land into the ocean,
                   it raises sea levels. Jakobshavn Isbrae is
                   Greenland's largest outlet glacier, draining
                   6.5 percent of Greenland's ice sheet area.
                   The ice stream's speed-up and near-doubling
                   of ice flow from land into the ocean has increased
                   the rate of sea level rise by about .06 millimeters
                   (about .002 inches) per year, or roughly 4
                   percent of the 20th century rate of sea level
                   increase. Also, the rapid movement of ice
                   from land into the sea provides key evidence
                   of newly discovered relationships between
                   ice sheets, sea level rise and climate warming.
                   The researchers found the glacier's sudden
                   speed-up also coincides with very rapid thinning,
                   indicating loss of ice of up to 15 meters
                   (49 feet) in thickness per year after 1997.
                   Along with increased rates of ice flow and
                   thinning, the thick ice that extends from
                   the mouth of the glacier into the ocean, called
                   the ice tongue, began retreating in 2000,
                   breaking up almost completely by May 2003.</span></p>

                   on record for Shetland and Orkney's teaming

                   a severe shortage of food. Almost all seabirds
                   breeding in Shetland's internationally important
                   colonies feed on sandeels, a small silvery
                   shoaling fish, which spends part of the time
                   buried in the sandy seabed. Recently, however,
                   these fish have become increasingly scarce....One
                   possible explanation for shortages of sandeels
                   may be that changes in climate have affected
                   sea temperatures and currents. This may have
                   affected the plankton on which the sandeels
                   feed forcing these small fish to move out
                   of reach for many of our seabirds. It's thought
                   that many of the small fish are not surviving

                 Arctic Sea Ice Study May Stir Up Climate Models</a>. <span>Contrary
                 to historical observations, sea ice in the high

                 movements twice a day, even in the dead of winter.

                 a recent NASA-funded study, the finding is significant.
                 Such movements may substantially increase the
                 production of new ice and should be factored
                 into Arctic climate models. The phenomenon of
                 short-period Arctic sea ice motion was investigated
                 in detail in 1967 and has been the subject of
                 numerous research studies since. A 1978 study

                 entirely during the winter once the Arctic Ocean

                   Pollution Changing Precipitation</a>, by ANDREW
                   BRIDGES, AP Science Writer. <span>The
                   massive amounts of heat and pollution that
                   rise from the world's cities both delay and
                   stimulate the fall of precipitation, cheating
                   some areas of much-needed rain and snow while
                   dousing others, scientists said. The findings
                   support growing evidence that urbanization
                   has a sharp and alarming effect on the climate,
                   and those changes can wreak havoc with precipitation
                   patterns that supply life's most precious
                   resource: water.</span></p>

                   measurements of maximum and minimum temperatures
                   from the Global Daily Climatological Network
                   data set, we find evidence of a weekly cycle
                   in diurnal temperature range (DTR) for many
                   stations in the United States, Mexico, Japan,
                   and China....We conclude that the weekend
                   effect is a real short time scale and large
                   spatial scale geophysical phenomenon, which
                   is necessarily human in origin. We thus provide
                   strong evidence of an anthropogenic link to
                   DTR, an important climate indicator. Several
                   possible anthropogenic mechanisms are discussed;
                   we speculate that aerosol-cloud interactions
                   are the most likely cause of this weekend
                   effect, but we do not rule out others. PNAS

                   years. <span>The book
                   would be useful with Life and Climate, since
                   many suggested activities have students monitoring
                   the effects of human activities on a variety
                   of things on local bodies of water, or ecosystems
                   in general. It also could be used with Ecosystem
                   Change, or Changing Climate for the same reason.
                   Students could use GIS to map changes in coastlines
                   due to erosion, the effects of storms on an
                   area, etc. It really emphasizes systems, so
                   it could be used with any of the GSS books.

                   LIKELY TO WARM 4-7 DEGREES BY 2100</a>. <span>There's
                   a nine out of ten chance that global average
                   temperatures will rise 3-9 degrees Fahrenheit
                   over the coming century, with a 4-7 degree
                   increase most likely, according to a new probability
                   analysis by scientists in the United States
                   and Europe. The most likely projected increase
                   is five times the one-degree temperature rise
                   observed over the past century. As early as
                   2030 the planet is likely to heat up 1-2 degrees,
                   say the scientists. The study by the National
                   Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) appears
                   in the July 20 issue of the journal Science. </span></p>
