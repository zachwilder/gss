                 on Climate Change.</a> By
                 ELISABETH ROSENTHAL, NY Times. <span>Excerpt: VALENCIA, Spain, Nov.
                   16 - In its final and most powerful
                   report, a United Nations panel of
                   scientists meeting here describes
                   the mounting risks of climate change
                   in language that is both more specific
                   and forceful than its previous assessments,
                   according to scientists here. ...the
                   United Nations Intergovernmental
                   Panel on Climate Change for the first
                   time specifically points out important
                   risks if governments fail to respond:
                   melting ice sheets that could lead
                   to a rapid rise in sea levels and
                   the extinction of large numbers of
                   species brought about by even moderate
                   amounts of warming, on the order
                   of 1 to 3 degrees.<br />
                   ..."This document goes further
                   than any of the previous efforts," said
                   Hans Verolme, director of the World
                   Wildlife Fund's Global Climate Change
                   Program. "The pressure has been
                   palpable - people know they are delivering
                   a document that will be cited for
                   years to come and will define policy."<br />
                   The previous three sections, released
                   between February and April, focused
                   on one issue at a time: the first
                   on science, the second on how the
                   world could adapt to warming and
                   the third about how countries could "mitigate," or
                   reduce the greenhouse gases produced.<br />
                   This fourth and final assessment
                   - the so-called synthesis report
                   - seeks to combine lessons from all
                   three. ...a powerful guide to what
                   the scientists consider of utmost
                   importance at the end of a five-year
                   process, offering concrete guidelines
                   for policy makers.<br />
                   "You look to a synthesis report
                   to provide clarity, to clarify what
                   was obscure in previous reports," said
                   Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist
                   at Princeton University. "Now,
                   how can we take these findings and
                   formulate a policy response that's
                   quick enough and big enough?"<br />
                   While drafts of the panel's reports
                   are written by panels of scientists,
                   the language is reviewed and often
                   altered by delegates from 130 governments
                   who meet before their final approval
                   and release. Those negotiations took
                   place here this week, and were often
                   contentious, with the United States,
                   China and India raising many objections,
                   said scientists who spoke on condition
                   of anonymity because they are not
                   allowed to publicly refer to any
                   countries by name.<br />
                   ...While the United States, Saudi
                   Arabia and China tried to change
                   the text in order to play down the
                   consequences of global warming, developing
                   nations - which will bear the initial
                   brunt of climate change - were much
                   more forceful than at previous meetings
                   in opposing these efforts, one scientist
                   who was in the negotiating room said....</span></p>

                 Join in Creating Regional Pacts
                 on Climate Change</a>. By JOHN
                 M. BRODER, NY Times.<span> Excerpt:
                   WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 - Frustrated
                   with the slow progress of legislation
                   in Washington on energy and global
                   warming, the nation's governors
                   have created regional agreements
                   to cap greenhouse gases and are
                   engaged in a concerted lobbying
                   effort to prod Congress to act.
                   Beginning Monday, three Western
                   governors will appear in a nationwide
                   television advertising campaign
                   sponsored by an environmental group
                   trying to generate public and political
                   support for climate change legislation
                   now before the Senate. The 30-second
                   ad features Arnold Schwarzenegger,
                   Republican of California; Jon Huntsman
                   Jr., Republican of Utah; and Brian
                   Schweitzer, Democrat of Montana,
                   standing in casual clothes in scenic
                   spots talking about the threat
                   posed by greenhouse gas emissions.
                   The nation's governors are acting,
                   but Congress is not, they say. "Now
                   it's their turn," Mr. Schwarzenegger
                   says.<br />
                   Separately, in Milwaukee on Wednesday,
                   nine Midwestern governors and the
                   premier of Manitoba signed an agreement
                   to reduce carbon emissions and set
                   up a trading system to meet the reduction
                   targets. The Midwestern accord is
                   modeled on similar regional carbon-reduction

                   Northeastern, Southwestern and West
                   Coast states.<br />
                   The advertising campaign is underwritten
                   by Environmental Defense, an advocacy
                   group that is pressing for quick
                   action on a climate change proposal
                   sponsored by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman,
                   an independent from Connecticut,
                   and John W. Warner, Republican of
                   Virginia.<br />
                   The Lieberman-Warner legislation
                   would cap carbon emissions at 15
                   percent below 2005 levels by 2020
                   and set up a system for polluting
                   industries to trade emissions credits
                   to meet the goals. Like other such
                   bills before Congress, it would provide
                   incentives for research on capturing
                   and storing carbon dioxide from power
                   plants and subsidies to help the
                   poor handle the higher costs of electricity
                   in a carbon-constrained economy....</span></p>

                   VALENCIA, Spain - The U.N.'s top
                   climate official warned policymakers
                   and scientists trying to hammer out
                   a landmark report on climate change
                   that ignoring the urgency of global
                   warming would be "criminally
                   irresponsible.<br />
                   Yvo de Boer's comments came at the
                   opening of a weeklong conference
                   that will complete a concise guide
                   on the state of global warming and
                   what can be done to stop the Earth
                   from overheating. It is the fourth
                   and last report issued this year
                   by the Intergovernmental Panel on
                   Climate Change, co-winner of this
                   year's Nobel Peace prize.<br />
                   ...Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of
                   the Nobel Prize-winning panel, said
                   scientists were determined to "adhere
                   to standards of quality" in
                   the report. It was indirect barb
                   at the government representatives,
                   who have been accused by environmentalists
                   of watering down and excluding vital
                   information from the summaries of
                   earlier reports to fit their domestic
                   agendas.<br />
                   ...The report will provide the factual
                   underpinning for a crucial meeting

                   That conference will begin exploring
                   a new global strategy to curb greenhouse
                   gas emissions after the 2012 expiration
                   of the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol,

                   OSLO, Oct. 12 - Former Vice President
                   Al Gore, who emerged from his loss
                   in the muddled 2000 presidential
                   election to devote himself to his
                   passion as an environmental crusader,
                   was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace
                   Prize on Friday, sharing it with
                   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
                   Change, a United Nations network
                   of scientists . The Norwegian Nobel
                   Committee praised both "for
                   their efforts to build up and disseminate
                   greater knowledge about man-made
                   climate change." The prize is
                   a vindication for Mr. Gore, whose
                   cautionary film about the consequences
                   of climate change, "An Inconvenient
                   Truth," won the 2007 Academy
                   Award for best documentary, even
                   as conservatives in the United States
                   denounced it as alarmist and exaggerated.
                   ...The award was also a validation
                   for the United Nations panel, which
                   in its early days was vilified by
                   those who disputed the scientific
                   case for a human role in climate
                   change. In New Delhi, the Indian
                   climatologist who heads the panel,

                   and Democrat, shared the world spotlight
                   to press for climate action.....President
                   Bush, who did take part later in
                   a small, private U.N. dinner with
                   key players on climate, rejects
                   the idea of international treaty
                   obligations to reduce emissions
                   of carbon dioxide and other ''greenhouse
                   gases'' blamed for global warming
                   -- an idea central to U.N. climate
                   negotiations.<br />
                   The Republican Schwarzenegger, on
                   the other hand, has taken the lead
                   on emissions caps at the state level,
                   signing legislation mandating such
                   reductions in California.<br />
                   .....''The need to act is now,''
                   Democrat Gore told delegates to the
                   one-day summit, which drew more than
                   80 world leaders. ''We need a mandate
                   at Bali.''<br />
                   He was referring the annual U.N.
                   climate treaty conference, scheduled
                   for December in Bali, Indonesia,
                   where the Europeans and others hope
                   to initiate talks for an emissions-reduction
                   agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol
                   in 2012.<br />
                   The 175-nation Kyoto pact, which
                   the U.S. rejects, requires 36 industrial
                   nations to reduce the heat-trapping
                   gases emitted by power plants and
                   other industrial, agricultural and
                   transportation sources...<br />
                   ....Bush objects that Kyoto-style
                   mandates would damage the U.S. economy
                   and says they should be imposed on
                   fast-growing poorer countries such
                   as China and India in addition to
                   developed nations...<br />
                   On Thursday and Friday, Bush will
                   host his own Washington climate meeting,
                   limited to 16 ''major emitter'' countries,
                   including China and India, the first
                   in a series of U.S.-led gatherings
                   expected to focus on those themes.<br />
                   ''The Washington meeting is a distraction,''
                   Hans Verolme, climate campaigner
                   for the Worldwide Fund for Nature,
                   told reporters here. The Bush administration
                   needs ''to show they are serious
                   and implement domestic legislation
                   to reduce emissions,'' he said.<br />
                   Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice,
                   speaking at the summit, put the Washington
                   meetings in a different light, describing

                   in Florida and more wildfires in

                   climate change on US lands and waters,
                   a congressional watchdog agency reported
                   on Thursday.<br />
                   ..."Undertaking activities that
                   address the effects of climate change
                   is currently not a priority" for
                   the five US agencies that manage
                   this territory, the report by the
                   nonpartisan investigative arm of
                   Congress said.<br />
                   These agencies are the Bureau of
                   Land Management, Forest Service,
                   Fish and Wildlife Service, National
                   Park Service and the National Oceanic
                   and Atmospheric Administration.<br />
                   The Interior Department, which includes
                   three of the five agencies, ordered
                   them in 2001 to analyze potential
                   climate change effects on US-managed
                   lands, but has not yet provided direction
                   to managers on how to plan for climate
                   change, the report said.<br />
                   Resource managers at the other two
                   agencies echoed that sentiment, according
                   to the report.<br />
                   ...The authors based their conclusions
                   on discussions with scientists, economists
                   and federal resource managers, and
                   field studies of four federal areas
                   that represent distinct ecosystems.<br />
                   These are: the Florida Keys National
                   Marine Sanctuary, representing coasts
                   and oceans; the Chugach National
                   Forest in Alaska, representing forests;
                   Glacier National Park in Montana,
                   representing fresh waters; and the
                   Bureau of Land Management's Arizona
                   field office, representing grasslands
                   and shrublands.<br />
                   In the Florida Keys, they found rising
                   sea levels that can be attributed
                   to climate change have already affected
                   low-lying areas, and saltwater intrusion
                   on land has cut the fresh water and
                   habitat that support native plants
                   and animals.<br />

                   Warmer temperatures and reduced precipitation
                   associated with climate change in
                   Alaska's Chugach National Forest
                   have contributed to outbreaks of
                   insects, such as the spruce bark
                   beetles which have killed some kinds
                   of spruce trees over the forest's
                   400,000 acres (161,900 hectares),
                   the report said.<br />
                   In Montana, the glaciers that give
                   Glacier National Park its name are
                   dwindling, down from 150 in 1950
                   to 26 now, according to the report.<br />
                   Arizona's Mojave Desert is suffering
                   more virulent wildfires due at least
                   in part to climate change, the report
                   said, because drought has damaged
                   native plants and allowed invasive
                   grasses to take over, making it easier
                   for fires to start and harder to
                   extinguish them.</span></p>

                 Ice Island Alarm</a>. By Kendall
                 Haven<br />
<span>Excerpt: In early spring, with the
                   summer melt still weeks away, researchers
                   flock like migrating birds to the
                   Greenland Ice Sheet. ...Waleed Abdalati,
                   head of NASA Goddard Space Flight
                   Center's Cryospheric Sciences Branch,
                   was one of those migrating researchers.
                   His boots were on the ice most years
                   from 1993 through 2004....<br />
                   Scientists and policy makers
                   asked: Is Greenland melting? If so,
                   how fast, and how high will sea level
                   rise as a result? "Through the
                   1990s, the only answer scientists
                   could give was 'We don't know,'" Abdalati
                   recalls.<br />
                   What would large-scale ice loss on
                   Greenland mean to the rest of the
                   world? "Things we've come to
                   count on could change," he explains.
                   Coastlines will recede as sea level
                   rises and ocean water edges inland,
                   threatening coastal cities. The changing
                   ice could impact ocean and atmospheric
                   circulation patterns and the global
                   climate to which life today has adapted.
                   What will be the nature and impact
                   of these changes? Abdalati's answer: "While
                   the future impacts of the changing
                   ice cover are uncertain, the potential
                   effects are scary enough so that
                   we better figure it out."<br />
                   ...Bill Krabill, a geoscientist at
                   NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, measured
                   an inland gain of up to 1 meter of
                   snow and up to three times average
                   snowfall in some areas of Southeast
                   Greenland between 2002 and 2003.
                   In 2005, Ola Johannessen, from the
                   University of Bergen's Nansen Environmental
                   and Remote Sensing Center, measured
                   a gain of 2.4 inches per year from
                   1992 to 2003 for elevations above
                   1,500 meters, with a net ice loss
                   below that elevation. But even if
                   the models were right, which trend-ice
                   gain in the interior, or melting

                   with a joint appointment at NASA's
                   Jet Propulsion Lab and the University
                   of Colorado... explains... "We

                   loss for the ice sheet of 248 gigatons
                   per year-enough to raise sea level
                   about half a millimeter each year.
                   (A gigaton is one billion metric

                   published similar findings shortly
                   after Velicogna, these GRACE results
                   showed a significantly larger loss-four
                   to five times more ice loss-than

                   on Monday establishing how the
                   state will reduce pollution and
                   cap power plant emissions in a
                   regional effort to reduce carbon
                   dioxide output. Maine is one of
                   10 Eastern states in the Regional
                   Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or R.G.G.I.
                   (pronounced “Reggie”),
                   which is intended to lower carbon
                   dioxide output from power plants.
                   ... Under the regional initiative,
                   other states, including Maryland,
                   can put into effect their rules
                   through their environmental protection
                   departments rather than their legislatures.
                   ... Maine accounts for 3 percent
                   of United States carbon emissions.
                   It will cap its emissions at 5.9
                   million tons in 2009, and reduce
                   them 10 percent by 2019. Under
                   the new law, six power plants will
                   start paying allowances to the
                   state in 2009 that let them emit

                   In research published today in

                   team - including CSIRO's Dr. Ray
                   Langenfelds - concludes that the
                   Southern Ocean carbon dioxide sink
                   has weakened over the past 25 years
                   and will be less efficient in the
                   future. Such weakening of one of
                   the Earth's major carbon dioxide
                   sinks will lead to higher levels
                   of atmospheric carbon dioxide in
                   the long-term. Dr. Paul Fraser,
                   ... leads research into atmospheric
                   greenhouse gases at CSIRO Marine
                   and Atmospheric Research.... "The
                   researchers found that the Southern
                   Ocean is becoming less efficient
                   at absorbing carbon dioxide due to
                   an increase in wind strength over
                   the Ocean, resulting from human-induced
                   climate change," Dr. Fraser
                   says. "The increase in wind
                   strength is due to a combination
                   of higher levels of greenhouse gases
                   in the atmosphere and long-term ozone
                   depletion in the stratosphere, which
                   previous CSIRO research has shown
                   intensifies storms over the Southern
                   Ocean." The increased winds
                   influence the processes of mixing
                   and upwelling in the ocean, which

                   A team of NASA and university scientists
                   has found clear evidence that extensive
                   areas of snow melted in west Antarctica
                   in January 2005 in response to warm
                   temperatures. This was the first
                   widespread Antarctic melting ever
                   detected with NASA's QuikScat satellite
                   and the most significant melt observed
                   using satellites during the past
                   three decades. Combined, the affected
                   regions encompassed an area as big
                   as California. Son Nghiem of NASA's
                   Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,
                   Calif., and Konrad Steffen, director
                   of the Cooperative Institute for
                   Research in Environmental Sciences
                   at the University of Colorado, Boulder,
                   led the team. Using data from QuikScat,
                   they measured snowfall accumulation
                   and melt in Antarctica and Greenland
                   from July 1999 through July 2005.<br />
                   ...Evidence of melting was found
                   up to 900 kilometers (560 miles)
                   inland from the open ocean, ...and
                   higher than 2,000 meters (6,600 feet)
                   above sea level. Maximum air temperatures
                   at the time of the melting were unusually
                   high, reaching more than five degrees
                   Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) in
                   one of the affected areas. They remained
                   above melting for approximately a
                   week. "Antarctica has shown
                   little to no warming in the recent
                   past ... but now large regions are
                   showing the first signs of the impacts
                   of warming as interpreted by this
                   satellite analysis," said Steffen.
                   ...Changes in the ice mass of Antarctica,
                   Earth's largest freshwater reservoir,
                   are important to understanding global
                   sea level rise. Large amounts of
                   Antarctic freshwater flowing into
                   the ocean also could affect ocean
                   salinity, currents and global climate.... </span></p>

                   international consultants and credit
                   brokers. ...before manufacturers
                   can obtain the subsidies, their national

                   general manager, said. But the payments
                   made the project more attractive
                   and made it easier to raise money

                 By HANNAH FAIRFIELD. NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   AMID steadily increasing carbon emissions,
                   and a federal government hesitant
                   to take the lead on climate legislation,
                   10 states have joined to create the
                   first mandatory carbon cap-and-trade
                   program in the United States. They
                   aim to reduce emissions from power
                   plants by 10 percent in 10 years.
                   Leaders of state environmental and
                   energy regulatory agencies hammered
                   out the detailed model for the program,
                   the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative,
                   over the course of three years. The
                   program sets a cap on the total amount
                   of carbon that the 10 states - as
                   a whole - can emit. Starting in 2009,
                   each state will receive a set amount
                   of carbon credits for its power plants,
                   and each plant must have enough allowances
                   to cover its total emissions at the
                   end of three-year compliance periods.
                   In 2003, George E. Pataki, then New
                   York's governor, invited governors
                   of 10 other states from Maine to
                   Maryland to discuss a program to
                   cut power plant emissions. All but
                   one of the states joined the program;
                   Pennsylvania has observer status.
                   Officials have closely watched the
                   European Union, which started its
                   carbon trading market in 2005. ...
                   In Europe, power companies received
                   these credits directly and could
                   buy or sell from one another as needed.
                   But most companies passed the cost
                   of the credits on to consumers even
                   though they received them free -
                   giving the companies windfall profits.
                   Power companies in Britain alone
                   made about $1 billion from free credits
                   in 2005, according to a study by
                   the British government....</span></p>

                   Climate scientists may have significantly
                   underestimated the power of global
                   warming from human-generated heat-trapping
                   gases to shrink the cap of sea ice
                   floating on the Arctic Ocean, according
                   to a new study of polar trends. The
                   study, published online today in
                   Geophysical Research Letters, concluded
                   that an open-water Arctic in summers
                   could be more likely in this century
                   than had been estimated in the latest
                   international review of climate research
                   released in February by the United
                   Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
                   Climate Change. "There are huge
                   changes going on," said Julienne
                   Stroeve, a lead author of the new
                   study and a researcher at the National
                   Snow and Ice Datajn Center in Boulder,

                   with warm waters entering the Arctic,
                   combined with warming air temperatures,
                   this is wreaking havoc on the sea
                   ice, really." The intergovernmental
                   panel concluded that if emissions
                   of heat-trapping gases like carbon
                   dioxide were not significantly reduced,
                   the region could end up bereft of
                   floating ice in summers sometime
                   between 2050 and the early decades

                   Merkel, current head of the European
                   Union and a physicist, to guide the
                   27-member bloc in March to an agreement
                   that is widely considered both a
                   critical and impressive step in the
                   battle against climate change....Under
                   the pact, achieved after months of
                   negotiations, the EU will cut greenhouse
                   gas emissions by one-fifth from 1990
                   levels and produce one-fifth of its
                   energy from renewable sources by
                   2020. As part of the plan, the EU
                   also set a 10% minimum target on
                   the use of biofuels for transport
                   by 2020. The agreement aims to address
                   climate change after the commitments
                   for industrialized nations contained
                   in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol expire
                   in 2012. EU member states are among
                   140 governments worldwide that participate
                   in Kyoto, which the US refused to
                   ratify (see PHYSICS TODAY, January
                   2002, page 26)...."We can say
                   to the rest of the world, 'Europe
                   is taking the lead. You should join
                   us in fighting climate change,' " Barroso
                   said....In January 2005, the EU adopted
                   the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading
                   Scheme, under which each member state
                   has a national allocation plan that
                   specifies caps on carbon emissions
                   for individual power plants and other
                   emissions sources. Each facility
                   gets a certain emissions allowance
                   for a particular period. To comply
                   with the cap, facilities can either
                   cut their emissions or buy allowances
                   from other facilities....In BP's
                   hydrogen program, coal is burned
                   to produce CO2 and hydrogen; the
                   CO2 is separated out and buried underground
                   while the hydrogen is burned to generate
                   power. "Needless
                   to say, it's more expensive than
                   the traditional way, just burning
                   the coal and venting the CO2 to the
                   atmosphere," Koonin acknowledged. "But

                   Far beyond signaling the day's weather,
                   clouds play a key role in regulating
                   and understanding climate. A team
                   of researchers recently completed
                   a project to confirm what NASA satellites
                   are telling us about how changes
                   in clouds can affect climate in the
                   coldest regions on Earth. ... In
                   2006, NASA simultaneously launched
                   a pair of satellites, CloudSat and
                   the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared
                   Pathfinder Satellite Observation
                   (CALIPSO), which together use state-of-the-art
                   instruments as they orbit the globe
                   to reveal detailed information about
                   clouds and their effect on climate.
                   ... "The polar regions are very
                   sensitive indicators of climate change," said
                   Deborah Vane, project manager and
                   deputy principal investigator for
                   the CloudSat mission at NASA's Jet
                   Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,
                   Calif. "It's been well reported
                   now that the polar ice caps are undergoing
                   net melting. There's a complicated
                   interaction between clouds and climate
                   in polar regions that can contribute
                   to temperature changes, and, in turn,
                   speed the rate at which ice melts." ...CloudSat
                   peers into clouds from hundreds of
                   miles above to allow researchers
                   a sneak peek into just how cloud
                   droplets change to become rain or
                   snow. CALIPSO uses laser technology
                   called lidar to gather data globally
                   that researchers will use to analyze
                   how clouds and aerosols affect the
                   atmosphere....</span></p>

                 CHANG. NY TIMES. <span>Excerpt:…NASA
                   is launching a small satellite
                   to take a closer look at these
                   clouds at the edge of outer space
                   and to try to understand why, in
                   recent years, they are appearing
                   more often over more parts of the
                   world. They are also becoming brighter.
                   The clouds are called noctilucent
                   or "night shining," because
                   from the ground they can be seen
                   only at night as they float about
                   50 miles above the surface, illuminated
                   by light from a Sun that has already
                   set below the horizon.  The
                   clouds form in the polar regions
                   from mid-May to mid-August in the
                   Northern Hemisphere, mid-November
                   to mid-February in the Southern
                   Hemisphere…A British sky
                   watcher named Thomas William Backhouse
                   was perhaps the first to notice
                   the odd blue wisps in 1885, and
                   many scientists thought that the
                   phenomenon was an atmospheric effect
                   caused by ash thrown up by the
                   gigantic volcanic eruption of Krakatoa
                   in Indonesia two years earlier.
                   Although the ash settled out of
                   the air, the noctilucent clouds
                   persisted and spread …..Since
                   1980, when regular space-based
                   observations of noctilucent clouds
                   began, their number has increased
                   about 28 percent per decade, and
                   they are reflecting more light,
                   because the ice crystals are bigger….."The
                   most plausible and leading theory
                   is CO2 buildup, which causes global
                   warming," Dr. Russell said.
                   Increasing temperatures near the
                   surface actually cause the upper
                   part of the atmosphere to cool,
                   and cooler temperatures could spur
                   the formation of more clouds. "If
                   that's true and we are changing
                   the atmosphere in a remote location
                   like this, that means we're changing
                   the entire atmosphere," he

                 Change Adds Twist to Debate Over Dams</a>.
                 By William Yardley. NY TIMES. KLAMATH
                 FALLS, Ore., April 19 -<span> Excerpt:
                   The power company that  owns  four
                   hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River
                   says the dams provide a crucial source
                   of so-called clean energy at a time
                   when carbon emissions have become one
                   of the world's foremost environmental
                   concerns. The clean-energy argument
                   has entered a debate over dams. But
                   the American Indians, fishermen and
                   environmentalists who want the dams
                   removed point  to
                   what has happened since the first one
                   was built nearly 90 years ago: endangered
                   salmon have been blocked from migrating,
                   Indian livelihoods have been threatened,
                   and, more recently, the commercial
                   fishing industry off the Oregon and
                   California coasts has been devastated.. …The
                   Klamath dams provide enough power to
                   serve about 70,000 homes, a small fraction
                   of PacifiCorp's 1.6 million customers,
                   which span six Western states. But
                   the company says only coal or natural
                   gas are likely to be reliable enough
                   to replace the river, which hits hydroelectric
                   turbines four times on its way to the
                   sea from east of the snow-capped Cascade
                   Range. Those who support removing the
                   dams largely dismiss the clean-energy
                   argument, saying the benefits outweigh
                   losing a relatively small source of
                   hydropower. They note that PacifiCorp's
                   increased interest in the environment
                   comes as recent rulings by judges and
                   federal fisheries agencies have given
                   new momentum for removal. The company's
                   federal license to run the dams expired
                   last year, and the government has said
                   PacifiCorp must build fish ladders
                   over the four dams to get a new license,
                   a proposition that could cost $300
                   million and reduce the power the dams
                   generate, potentially making removal
                   a less costly choice……The
                   Klamath runs more than 250 miles from
                   southwest Oregon to the California
                   coast, connecting two states where
                   power and water supply have long been
                   contentious issues……The
                   Northwest, where more than 80 percent
                   of the power generated comes from hydroelectricity,
                   has long had some of the lowest electricity
                   rates in the nation. It has also been
                   the setting for epic environmental
                   fights that reflect the tension across
                   the region's topographic and demographic
                   divides…… </span></p>

                     as reduced demand for heating, increased
                     crop yields and increased forest growth.

                   BRUSSELS, April 6 - In its most
                   detailed portrait of the effects
                   of climate change driven by human
                   activities, the panel predicted widening

                   the American Southwest and Mexico,
                   and flooding that could imperil low-lying
                   islands and the crowded river deltas
                   of southern Asia. It stressed that
                   many of the regions facing the greatest
                   risks were among the world's poorest.
                   And it said that while limits on
                   smokestack and tailpipe emissions
                   could lower the long-term risks,
                   vulnerable regions must adjust
                   promptly to shifting weather patterns,
                   climatic and coastal hazards, and
                   rising seas.<br />
                   Without such adaptations, it said,
                   a rise of 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit
                   over the next century could lead
                   to the inundation of coasts and islands
                   inhabited by hundreds of millions
                   of people. But if steady investments

                   United Nations' Intergovernmental
                   Panel on Climate Change, also noted
                   that the climate shifts would benefit
                   some regions - leading to more rainfall
                   and longer growing seasons in high
                   latitudes, open Arctic seaways and
                   fewer deaths from the cold. ...Under
                   pressure from nations including Russia,

                 Draft Cites Humans in Recent Climate
                 Shifts</a> By ANDREW C. REVKIN.
                 NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   The latest United Nations assessment
                   of the role of humans in global
                   warming has found with "high
                   confidence" that
                   greenhouse gas emissions are at least
                   partly responsible for a host of
                   changes already under way, including
                   longer growing seasons and shrinking
                   glaciers. ...Some of the changes
                   could be beneficial, but most will
                   prove harmful in the long run, the
                   report says. It finds that global
                   warming caused by humans has almost
                   certainly contributed to recent shifts
                   in ecosystems, weather patterns,
                   oceans and icy regions, and that
                   it will have large and lasting effects
                   on human affairs and on the planet's
                   web of life in this century. The
                   draft report predicts a variety of
                   health effects as well, with "increased
                   deaths, disease and injury due to
                   heat waves, floods, storms, fires
                   and droughts," but also "some
                   benefits to health such as fewer
                   deaths from cold." Also in the
                   plus column, higher concentrations
                   of carbon dioxide... are contributing
                   to a greener world.... "Based
                   on satellite observations since the
                   early 1980s, ...there has been a
                   trend in many regions towards earlier
                   greening of vegetation in the spring
                   and increased net primary production
                   linked to longer growing seasons
                   and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations," it
                   said. ...Water supplies fed by alpine
                   snows or ice sheets are already experiencing
                   changes and could be greatly disrupted....
                   Among other findings, the draft says: "Coasts
                   are very likely to be exposed to
                   increasing risks due to climate change
                   and sea-level rise, and the effect
                   will be exacerbated by increasing
                   human-induced pressures on coastal
                   areas." "It
                   is likely that corals will experience
                   a major decline due to increased
                   bleaching and mortality due to rising
                   seawater temperatures." Many
                   of the world's regions that are already
                   vulnerable to climate and coastal
                   hazards are likely to see the biggest
                   effects from additional changes driven
                   by the buildup of greenhouse gases. "Poor
                   communities can be especially vulnerable," it
                   says, "because they tend to
                   be concentrated in relatively high-risk
                   areas, have more limited coping capacities,
                   and can be more dependent on climate-sensitive
                   resources such as local water and
                   food supplies." ....</span></p>

                 Gases</a>. By Paul
                 Ames, The Associated Press. <span>Excerpt:
                   European Union leaders on Friday
                   endorsed binding targets to cut greenhouse
                   gases and ensure a fifth of the bloc's
                   energy comes from green power such
                   as wind turbines and solar panels.
                   The deal also noted the role nuclear
                   power could play in tackling greenhouse
                   gas emissions, an inclusion not welcomed
                   by all leaders. ...European Commission
                   President Jose Manuel Barroso called
                   the measures "the most ambitious
                   package ever agreed by any institution
                   on energy security and climate change."...European
                   leaders hope their commitment to
                   tackling climate change will encourage
                   other leading polluters like the
                   United States and China to agree
                   on deep emissions cuts.<br />
                   ...The deal contains a reference
                   to the role of nuclear power, a demand
                   of the French, Czechs, Slovaks and
                   others who argued it could play a
                   crucial part in helping Europe move
                   away from carbon fuels. ...Austria,
                   Ireland and Denmark did not want
                   the EU to sanction nuclear power,
                   and the German government is split
                   over whether to develop atomic energy. "Our
                   Austrian attitude toward sustainable
                   energy definitely does not include
                   nuclear energy," Foreign Minister
                   Ursula Plassnik told reporters. Friends
                   of the Earth said it was appalled
                   by the mention of nuclear power.  "Nuclear
                   energy is too expensive," said
                   Jan Kowalzig, a campaigner with the
                   group. "Nations should invest
                   more cleverly in developing other
                   energy sources." He called the
                   20 percent target for renewables "too
                   low," but said the group was
                   pleased it was binding.</span></p>

                 Impact More Extensive than Thought</a>.
                 By Volker Mrasek, Spiegel Online. <span>Excerpt:
                   Global climate change is happening
                   faster than previously believed
                   and its impact is worse than expected,
                   information from an as-yet unpublished
                   draft of the long-awaited second
                   part of a United Nations report
                   obtained by SPIEGEL ONLINE reveals.
                   No region of the planet will be spared
                   and some will be hit especially hard....The
                   second part of the [IPCC] report
                   is to be presented in April ....
                   The main conclusion of the report
                   is that climate change is already
                   having a profound effect on all the
                   continents and on many of the Earth's
                   ecosystems. The draft presents a
                   long list of evidence:</span></p>
<ul><li>Glacial
                   lakes are increasing in both
                   size and number, potentially
                   leading to deadly floods.</li>
<li>Permafrost
                   in mountainous regions and at
                   high latitudes is warming increasing
                   the danger of land slides.</li>
<li>As
                   the temperature of rivers and
                   lakes rises, their thermal stratification
                   and water quality is changing.</li>
<li> River
                   currents, affected by melting
                   glaciers and ice, are speeding
                   up during the spring.</li>
<li> Springtime
                   is starting earlier, causing
                   plants to bloom earlier and changing
                   the migrations of birds.</li>
<li>Many
                   plants and animals are expanding
                   their habitats into mountainous
                   regions and higher latitudes that
                   are becoming milder.....<br />
                   Many natural resources are likely
                   to fall victim to climate change
                   according to the IPCC draft report:</li>
<li>Some
                   20 to 30 percent of all species
                   face a "high risk
                   of extinction" should
                   average global temperatures rise
                   another 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius
                   from their 1990 levels. That could
                   happen by 2050, the report warns.</li>
<li>Coral
                   reefs are "likely to
                   undergo strong declines."</li>
<li>Salt
                   marshes and mangrove forests
                   could disappear as sea levels
                   rise.</li>
<li>Tropical
                   rainforests will be replaced
                   by savanna in those regions where
                   groundwater decreases.</li>
<li>Migratory
                   birds and mammals will suffer
                   as vegetation zones in the Artic
                   shift.<br />
                   The IPCC expects the following
                   world regions to suffer the most
                   due to climate change:</li>
<li>The
                   Arctic due to the greatest relative
                   warming</li>
<li>Small
                   island states in the Pacific
                   as sea levels rise</li>
<li>Africa
                   south of the Sahel zone due to
                   drought</li>
<li>Densely
                   populated river deltas in Asia
                   amid flooding....</li></ul>

                 By MATTHEW L. WALD, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   As Democratic leaders in Congress prepare
                   to put climate change legislation on
                   the agenda, some in the utility industry
                   are arguing that it will take decades
                   of investments and innovation to get
                   substantial reductions in their emissions
                   of greenhouse gases. Electric power
                   companies, which emit about one-third
                   of America's global warming gases,
                   could reduce their emissions to below
                   the levels of 1990, but that would
                   take about 20 years, no matter how
                   much the utilities spend, according
                   to a new industry study. The report,
                   prepared by the Electric Power Research
                   Institute, a nonprofit consortium,
                   is portrayed as highly optimistic by
                   its authors, who will present the findings
                   on Thursday at an energy conference
                   in Houston. It assumes that "money
                   grows on trees and all research is
                   successful," said one of them,
                   Bryan J. Hannegan. "This is as
                   good as we think we can get, right
                   now."  ...The 1990 Kyoto Protocol
                   on climate change, which the Bush administration
                   declined to support in 2001, calls
                   for emissions from large industrial
                   nations to be below 1990 levels by
                   about the year 2010. In an interview,
                   Dr. Hannegan said that cutting carbon
                   dioxide that much would mean pursuing
                   every option, including energy efficiency,
                   zero-carbon wind and sun power; new
                   nuclear reactors; coal plants that
                   capture and sequester their carbon;
                   and even plug-in hybrid electric cars,
                   which would require making more electricity
                   but would reduce carbon dioxide and
                   save gasoline....</span></p>

                 Says Rich Countries Should Take
                 Lead on Global Warming</a>. By
                 JIM YARDLEY, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   BEIJING, Feb. 6 - China said Tuesday
                   that wealthier countries must take
                   the lead in curbing greenhouse
                   gas emissions and refused to say
                   whether it would agree to any mandatory
                   emissions limits that might hamper
                   its booming economy. Jiang Yu, a
                   spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry,
                   said ... "It must
                   be pointed out that climate change
                   has been caused by the long-term
                   historic emissions of developed countries
                   and their high per capita emissions," she
                   said, adding that developed countries
                   have responsibilities for global
                   warming "that cannot be shirked." ...China
                   is the world's second largest emitter
                   of the greenhouse gases contributing
                   to climate change, .... Last November,
                   the International Energy Agency in
                   Paris predicted that China would
                   pass the United States in emissions
                   of carbon dioxide in 2009. ...Qin
                   Dahe, chief of the China Meteorological
                   Administration, told reporters ... "President
                   Hu Jintao has said that climate change
                   is not just an environmental issue
                   but also ... ultimately a development
                   issue." ..."As a developing
                   country that's growing rapidly and
                   has a big population, to thoroughly
                   transform the energy structure and
                   use clean energy would need a lot
                   of money," Mr. Qin said, according
                   to Reuters.... </span></p>

                   Jefferson once said something like,
                   'Science is my passion, politics
                   my duty,' " Dr. Solomon, 51,
                   said Sunday.... "That's probably
                   how I think about it, too. Science
                   does have a duty, when called upon,
                   to provide information that's important
                   to society the best way it can." In
                   place of making expeditions to the
                   South Pole and Greenland, her old
                   stomping grounds, she spent chunks
                   of the last five years hunkered in
                   gray buildings in Beijing, New Delhi,
                   Marrakech and Paris running meeting
                   after meeting of experts from the
                   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
                   Change. The panel was convened by
                   the United Nations in 1988 ... to
                   provide regular reviews of climate
                   science to governments to inform
                   policy choices. Dr. Solomon, a senior
                   scientist for the National Oceanic
                   and Atmospheric Administration, and
                   Qin Dahe, head of the Chinese meteorological
                   agency, were charged with generating
                   the fourth report and summary since
                   1990 of advances in climate science.
                   The final editing ... involved approval
                   by 113 governments. Several participants
                   credited Dr. Solomon with ensuring
                   that last-minute demands, particularly
                   from China and the United States,
                   did not derail the process or distort
                   the science. ...When a reporter asked
                   Dr. Solomon "to sum up what
                   kind of urgency this sort of report
                   should convey to policy makers," she
                   gave the furthest thing from a convenient
                   sound bite. "I can only give
                   you something that's going to disappoint
                   you, sir, and that is that it's my
                   personal scientific approach to say
                   it's not my role to try to communicate
                   what should be done," Dr. Solomon
                   said. "I believe that is a societal
                   choice. I believe science is one
                   input to that choice, and I also
                   believe that science can best serve
                   society by refraining from going
                   beyond its expertise.... Dr. Solomon,
                   who fell in love with science at
                   age 9 after watching Jacques Cousteau's
                   films about the sea, said she was
                   unfazed by the pressures of working
                   on the panel. She faces months of
                   additional work on reports related
                   to the summary. After that, she said,
                   she plans to take a little time off
                   and, for the first time, really,
                   enjoy the Rocky Mountains around
                   her base in Boulder, Colo. "I'm
                   going to learn how to fish," she

                 3, 2007. <span>Excerpt:
                   PARIS, Feb. 2 - In a grim and powerful
                   assessment of the future of the
                   planet, the leading international
                   network of climate scientists has
                   concluded for the first time that
                   global warming is "unequivocal" and
                   that human activity is the main
                   driver, "very likely" causing
                   most of the rise in temperatures
                   since 1950. ..."In our daily
                   lives we all respond urgently to
                   dangers that are much less likely
                   than climate change to affect the
                   future of our children," said
                   Achim Steiner, executive director
                   of the United Nations Environment
                   Program.... The report is the panel's
                   fourth assessment ... global climate
                   is likely to warm 3.5 to 8 degrees
                   Fahrenheit if carbon dioxide concentrations
                   in the atmosphere reach twice the
                   levels of 1750, before the Industrial
                   Revolution. ...It forecasts a [sea
                   level] rise of 7 to 23 inches by
                   2100 and concludes that seas will
                   continue to rise for at least 1,000
                   years to come. ...John P. Holdren,
                   an energy and climate expert at
                   Harvard, said the report "powerfully
                   underscores the need for a massive
                   effort to slow the pace of global
                   climatic disruption before intolerable
                   consequences become inevitable.
                   Since 2001, there has been a torrent
                   of new scientific evidence on the
                   magnitude, human origins and growing
                   impacts of the climatic changes
                   that are under way," said Mr.
                   Holdren, who is the president of
                   the American Association for the
                   Advancement of Science. "In
                   overwhelming proportions, this evidence
                   has been in the direction of showing
                   faster change, more danger and greater
                   confidence about the dominant role
                   of fossil-fuel burning and tropical
                   deforestation in causing the changes
                   that are being observed.".....</span></p>

                 By ANDREW C. REVKIN NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   ... until yesterday, it appeared
                   that no news release on annual
                   climate trends out of the National
                   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
                   under the Bush White House had
                   said unequivocally that a buildup
                   of greenhouse gases was helping
                   warm the climate. The statement
                   came in a release that said 2006
                   was the warmest year for the 48
                   contiguous states since regular
                   temperature records began in 1895.
                   It surpassed the previous champion,
                   1998, a year heated up by a powerful
                   episode of the periodic warming of
                   the tropical Pacific Ocean by El
                   Ni–o. Last year, another El
                   Ni–o developed, but this time
                   a long-term warming trend from human
                   activities was said to be involved
                   as well. "A contributing factor
                   to the unusually warm temperatures
                   throughout 2006 also is the long-term
                   warming trend, which has been linked
                   to increases in greenhouse gases," the
                   release said, emphasizing that the
                   relative contributions of El Ni–o
                   and the human influence were not
                   known. A link between greenhouse
                   gases and climate change was also
                   made in a December news conference
                   by Dirk Kempthorne, the secretary
                   of the interior, as that agency proposed
                   listing polar bears as threatened
                   under the Endangered Species Act.
                   Still, the climate agency's shift
                   in language came as a surprise to
                   several public affairs officials
                   there. They said they had become
                   accustomed in recent years to having
                   any mention of a link between climate
                   trends and human activities played
                   down or trimmed when drafts of documents

                 BARRINGER. NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9 - Gov. Arnold
                   Schwarzenegger said Tuesday that
                   he would ask regulators to require
                   the state's petroleum refiners and
                   gasoline sellers to cut by 10 percent
                   the emissions of heat-trapping gases
                   associated with the production and
                   use of their products. ...It is the
                   first example of the practical impact
                   of a deal made last summer between
                   the Legislature and the governor
                   to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
                   by about 25 percent by 2020. The
                   transportation sector is responsible
                   for about 40 percent of the state's
                   carbon dioxide emissions, state officials
                   said, and cars make up about half
                   that amount. The 10 percent cut in
                   emissions would be accomplished,
                   experts said, largely through the
                   use of alternative fuels, like ethanol
                   and other gasoline blends, which
                   would be provided by the refineries
                   and other producers. Hal Harvey,
                   the environmental program director
                   for the William and Flora Hewlett
                   Foundation, called Mr. Schwarzenegger's
                   plan "a
                   really big deal." "In my
                   opinion there are no successful rules
                   anywhere in the world, except Brazil,
                   to get carbon out of fuels," Mr.
                   Harvey said. ...Mr. Harvey and Fred
                   Krupp, the president of Environmental
                   Defense, said they hoped that the
                   California approach would be a template
                   for other governments, whether in
                   state capitals, in Washington or
                   abroad. The plan, Mr. Harvey said,
                   is unusual in its focus on the so-called
                   cradle-to-grave emissions associated
                   with each fuel. In the case of ethanol,
                   this can mean carbon emissions generated
                   in the production of fertilizer,
                   in the planting and harvesting of
                   corn, in distilling the fuel and,
                   finally, in transporting it to the
                   distributor and burning it in a car.
                   Thus, two otherwise identical gallons
                   of ethanol could have different greenhouse-gas
                   ratings, if one were refined using
                   carbon-intensive coal-fired electricity,
                   while the other was refined using
                   relatively carbon-light electricity
                   from natural gas.....</span></p>

                   carbon dioxide, as part of the Kyoto Protocol.
                   Among their targets is a large rusting chemical
                   factory here in southeastern China. Its
                   emissions of just one waste gas contribute
                   as much to global warming each year as the
                   emissions from a million American cars,
                   each driven 12,000 miles. Cleaning up this
                   factory will require an incinerator that
                   costs $5 million - far less than the cost
                   of cleaning up so many cars, or other sources
                   of pollution in Europe and Japan. Yet the
                   foreign companies will pay roughly $500
                   million for the incinerator - 100 times
                   what it cost. The high price is set in a
                   European-based market in carbon dioxide
                   emissions. Because the waste gas has a far
                   more powerful effect on global warming than
                   carbon dioxide emissions, the foreign businesses
                   must pay a premium far beyond the cost of
                   the actual cleanup. The huge profits from
                   that will be divided by the chemical factory's
                   owners, a Chinese government energy fund,
                   and the consultants and bankers who put
                                       together the deal from a mansion in the
                   wealthy Mayfair district of London. ...But
                   critics of the fast-growing program, through
                   which European and Japanese companies are
                   paying roughly $3 billion for credits this
                   year, complain that it mostly enriches a
                   few bankers, consultants and factory owners.
                   With so much money flowing to a few particularly
                   lucrative cleanup deals, the danger is that
                   they will distract attention from the broader
                   effort to curb global warming gases, and
                   that the lure of quick profit will encourage
                   short-term fixes at the expense of fundamental,
                   long-run solutions, including developing
        renewable energy sources like solar power....</span>

                 OCEAN FOOD SUPPLY</a>. NASA RELEASE: 06-364<span> Excerpt:
                   WASHINGTON - In a NASA study, scientists
                   have concluded that when Earth's climate
                   warms, there is a reduction in the ocean's
                   primary food supply. This poses a potential
                   threat to fisheries and ecosystems. By comparing
                   nearly a decade of global ocean satellite
                   data with several records of Earth's changing
                   climate, scientists found that whenever
                   climate temperatures warmed, marine plant
                   life in the form of microscopic phytoplankton
                   declined. Whenever climate temperatures
                   cooled, marine plant life became more vigorous
                   or productive. The findings will appear
                   in the journal Nature on Dec. 7. ...Phytoplankton
                   are microscopic plants living in the upper
                   sunlit layer of the ocean. They are responsible
                   for approximately the same amount of photosynthesis
                   each year as all land plants combined. Changes
                   in phytoplankton growth and photosynthesis
                   influence fishery yields, marine bird populations
                   and the amount of carbon dioxide the oceans
                   remove from the atmosphere. ... Scientists
                   made their discovery by comparing the SeaWiFS
                   record of the rise and fall of global ocean
                   plant life to different measures of recent
                   global climate change...</span></p>

                 Warming Goes to Court</a>. <span>Excerpt:
                   The Bush administration has been on a six-year
                   campaign to expand its powers, often beyond
                   what the Constitution allows. So it is odd
                   to hear it claim that it lacks the power
                   to slow global warming by limiting the emission
                   of harmful gases. But that is just what
                   it will argue to the Supreme Court tomorrow,
                   in what may be the most important environmental
                   case in many years.<br />
                   A group of 12 states, including New York
                   and Massachusetts, is suing the Environmental
                   Protection Agency for failing to properly
                   do its job. These states, backed by environmental
                   groups and scientists, say that the Clean
                   Air Act requires the E.P.A. to impose
                   limits on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
                   gases emitted by new cars. The Bush administration
                   insists that the E.P.A. does not have
                   the power to limit these gases. It argues
                   that they are not "air pollutants" under
                   the Clean Air Act. The act says that the
                   E.P.A. "shall" set standards
                   for "any air pollutant" that
                   in its judgment causes or contributes
                   to air pollution that "may reasonably
                   be anticipated to endanger public health
                   or welfare." The word "welfare," the
                   law says, includes "climate" and "weather." 
                   Beneath the statutory and standing questions,
                   this is a case about how seriously the
                   government takes global warming. </span></p>

                 C. REVKIN, NY Times <span>Exceprt:
                   NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov. 17 - The yearly United
                   Nations conference on climate change ended
                   Friday with only modest results after delegates
                   failed to establish a timetable for future
                   cuts on pollution linked to global warming.
                   Despite nearly two weeks of meetings, which
                   drew 6,000 participants to Nairobi from
                   around the world, the delegates could not
                   agree on a number of issues, especially
                   how to move beyond the Kyoto Protocol, which
                   requires cuts in emissions by most industrialized
                   countries but expires in 2012. Two persistent
                   problems were American reluctance to agree
                   to any mandatory emissions limits and increased
                   stubbornness by China and India, two of
                   the world's fastest-growing polluters, which
                   face no penalties under the Kyoto agreement
                   for all the heat-trapping gases they pump
                   into the atmosphere.</span></p>

                 Approves 'Carbon Tax' in Effort to Reduce
                 Gas Emissions.</a> By KATIE KELLEY, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   BOULDER, Colo., Nov. 14 - Voters in this
                   liberal college town have approved what
                   environmentalists say may be the nation's
                   first "carbon tax," intended to
                   reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases.
                   The tax, to take effect on April 1, will
                   be based on the number of kilowatt-hours
                   used. Officials say it will add $16 a year
                   to an average homeowner's electricity bill
                   and $46 for businesses. City officials said
                   the revenue from the tax - an estimated
                   $6.7 million by 2012, when the goal is to
                   have reduced carbon emissions by 350,000
                   metric tons - would be collected by the
                   main gas and electric utility, Xcel Energy,
                   and funneled through the city's Office of
                   Environmental Affairs. The tax is to pay
                   for the "climate action plan," efforts
                   to "increase energy efficiency in homes
                   and buildings, switch to renewable energy
                   and reduce vehicle miles traveled," the
                   city's environmental affairs manager, Jonathan
                   Koehn, said. The goal is to reduce the carbon
                   levels to 7 percent less than those in 1990,
                   which amounts to a 24 percent reduction
                   from current levels, Mr. Koehn said. ...The
                   tax grew out of efforts by a committee of
                   residents and members of the City Council
                   and Chamber of Commerce to try to enable
                   Boulder to reach goals set by the United
                   Nations Kyoto Protocol, which seeks to curb
                   global warming. The protocol requires 35
                   developing nations to reduce their emissions
                   of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.
                   The world's top two polluters, the United
                   States and China, have not signed the pact.
                   The Boulder environmental sustainability
                   coordinator, Sarah Van Pelt, said residents
                   who used alternative sources of electricity
                   like wind power would receive a discount
                   on the tax based on the amount of the alternative
                   power used. A total of 5,600 residents and
                   210 businesses use wind power, Ms. Van Pelt
                   said...</span></p>

                   Falling in Race to Fight Global Warming</a>.
                 By ANDREW C. REVKIN. NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   ...For all the enthusiasm about alternatives
                   to coal and oil, the challenge of limiting
                   emissions of carbon dioxide, which traps heat,
                   will be immense in a world likely to add 2.5
                   billion people by midcentury, a host of other
                   experts say. Moreover, most of those people
                   will live in countries like China and India,
                   which are just beginning to enjoy an electrified,
                   air-conditioned mobile society. The challenge
                   is all the more daunting because research
                   into energy technologies by both government
                   and industry has not been rising, but rather
                   falling. In the United States, annual federal
                   spending for all energy research and development
                   - not just the research aimed at climate-friendly
                   technologies - is less than half what it was
                   a quarter-century ago. It has sunk to $3 billion
                   a year in the current budget from an inflation-adjusted
                   peak of $7.7 billion in 1979, according to
                   several different studies. ...Still, more
                   than four dozen scientists, economists, engineers
                   and entrepreneurs interviewed by The New York
                   Times said that unless the search for abundant
                   non-polluting energy sources and systems became
                   far more aggressive, the world would probably
                   face dangerous warming and international strife
                   as nations with growing energy demands compete
                   for increasingly inadequate resources. Most
                   of these experts also say existing energy
                   alternatives and improvements in energy efficiency
                       are simply not enough. "We cannot come
                   close to stabilizing temperatures" unless
                   humans, by the end of the century, stop adding
                   more CO2 to the atmosphere than it can absorb,
                   said W. David Montgomery of Charles River
                   Associates, a consulting group, "and
                   that will be an economic impossibility without
                   a major R.&amp; D. investment." ...Without
                   big reductions in emissions, the midrange
                   projections of most scenarios envision a rise
                   of 4 degrees or so in this century, four times
                   the warming in the last 100 years. That could,
                   among other effects, produce a disruptive
                   mix of intensified flooding and withering
                   droughts in the world's prime agricultural
                   regions. ...A typical new coal-fired power
                   plant, one of the largest sources of emissions,
                   is expected to operate for many decades. About
                   one large coal-burning plant is being commissioned
                   a week, mostly in China. ...Many experts say
                   this means the only way to affordably speed
                   the transition to low-emissions energy is
                   with advances in technologies at all stages
                   of maturity. Examples include: Substantially
                   improving the efficiency and cost of solar
                   panels; Conducting full-scale tests of systems
                   for capturing carbon dioxide from power plants
                   and pumping it underground; Seeking efficient
                   ways to generate fuels from crops; Finding
                   new ways to store vast amounts of energy
                   harvested intermittently from the wind and
                   sun....Another area requiring immediate
                   intensified work, Dr. Holdren and other

                     announced an agreement on Wednesday that

                 C. REVKIN. NY Times. <span>As
                   the world heads toward a midcentury population
                   of some nine billion people with at least
                   twice today's energy thirst, one vital way
                   to limit global warming, many scientists
                   say, will be to capture the heat-trapping
                   carbon dioxide emitted by coal-fired power
                   plants. But what can you do with what will
                   amount to tens of billions of tons of the
                   gas? Pumping carbon dioxide into the earth
                   or deep into the sea have been suggested.
                   But some escape is possible in both cases.
                   Now a team of researchers propose what they
                   say is a limitless, low-risk repository
                   for carbon dioxide: seafloor sediments at
                   depths and temperatures that would guarantee
                   it would stay denser than the water above,
                   and thus be permanently locked away. ...Several
                   hundred yards beneath the seabed in waters
                   about 10,000 feet deep, the temperature
                   is typically about 35 degrees and the pressure
                   from the water overhead would cause liquid
                   carbon dioxide pumped into porous sediment
                   to stay denser than water, the researchers

                 Explains Puzzling Impact of Polluted Skies
                 on Climate.</a> <span>Excerpt:
                   NASA scientists have determined that the
                   formation of clouds is affected by the lightness
                   or darkness of air pollution particles.
                   This also impacts Earth's climate. In a
                   breakthrough study published today in the
                   online edition of Science, scientists explain
                   why aerosols -- tiny particles suspended
                   in air pollution and smoke -- sometimes
                   stop clouds from forming and in other cases
                   increase cloud cover. Clouds not only deliver
                   water around the globe, they also help regulate
                   how much of the sun's warmth the planet
                   holds. The capacity of air pollution to
                   absorb energy from the sun is the key. "When
                   the overall mixture of aerosol particles
                   in pollution absorbs more sunlight, it is
                   more effective at preventing clouds from
                   forming. When pollutant aerosols are lighter
                   in color and absorb less energy, they have
                   the opposite effect and actually help clouds
                   to form," said Lorraine Remer of NASA's
                   Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,
                   Md. Remer worked closely with the study's

                   building a wind farm..., buying power generated

                   developed countries have adopted under the
                   Kyoto Protocol. Some United States businesses,
                   though, are responding for a variety of
                   reasons anyway: to satisfy customers or
                   shareholders who worry about the environment,
                   to improve their public image or to drive
                   down their energy costs. ...The United States
                   is responsible for a quarter of all the
                   carbon dioxide sent into the atmosphere
                   each year. It has not ratified the Kyoto

                   internationally," 
                   said Adam Markham, executive director of
                   Clean Air-Cool Planet, .... "Most of
                   the rest of the developing world has a legislative

                   over the last decade and a half. I.B.M.
                   saved $115 million since 1998 by avoiding
                   1.3 million tons of carbon emissions, or
                   the equivalent of taking 51,600 cars off
                   the road, according to the climate change
                   program at the World Wildlife Fund. Other

                   and the Gap, have pledged voluntary reductions
                   in their emissions. Wal-Mart, the world's

                   the lower atmosphere was indeed growing
                   warmer and that there was "clear evidence
                   of human influences on the climate system." The
                   finding eliminates a significant area of
                   uncertainty in the debate over global warming,
                   one that the administration has long cited

                   on what it says would be costly limits on
                   emissions of heat-trapping gases. ... The
                   officials said that while the new finding
                   was important, the administration's policy
                   remained focused on studying the remaining
                   questions and using voluntary means to slow
                   the growth in emissions of heat-trapping
                   gases like carbon dioxide. ...The new study
                   found that "there is no longer a discrepancy
                   in the rate of global average temperature
                   increase for the surface compared with higher
                   levels in the atmosphere," in the words
                   of a news release issued by the Commerce
                   Department and approved by the White House.
                   The report was published yesterday online
                   at <a href="http://climatescience.gov/" target="_blank">http://climatescience.gov</a>.
                   ... The study said that the only factor
                   that could explain the measured warming
                   of Earth's average temperature over the
                   last 50 years was the buildup heat-trapping
                   gases, which are mainly emitted by burning
                   coal and oil. ...John R. Christy, an author
                   of the new report whose analysis of satellite
                   temperature records long showed little warming
                   above Earth's surface, said he endorsed
                   the conclusion that "part of what has
                   happened over the last 50 years has clearly
                   been caused by humans." ...Dr. Christy
                   also said that even given what the models
                   projected, it would be impossible to slow
                   warming noticeably in the coming decades.
                   Countries would be wise to seek ways to
                   adapt to warming, he added, even as they
                   seek new sources of energy that do not emit

                   2010, and to 1990 levels by 2020. "Managing
                   Greenhouse Gas Emissions in California," issued
                   on Monday, Jan. 23, finds that just eight
                   policy strategies can take California halfway
                   to the governor's 2020 targets while increasing
                   the Gross State Product by approximately
                   $60 billion and creating more than 20,000
                   new jobs. "Our study demonstrates that
                   taking action to reduce global-warming emissions
                   in California is good for the California
                   economy," said Michael Hanemann, professor
                   of agricultural and resource economics and
                   co-author of the report. "Our research
                   indicates that not only does climate action
                   pay, but early climate action pays more." ...we
                   find that the aggregate economic benefits
                   of many GHG-mitigating policies outweigh
                   their microeconomic costs, and more generally
                   that it is possible for the state to reconcile
                   growth and environmental objectives....</span></p>

                     Struggles to Downplay Risks. With each passing
                     month, research scientists discover new
                     evidence that the threat of global climate
                     change is growing more urgent and that world
                     leaders must act immediately to forestall
                     serious and potentially irreversible warming.
                     Since 1990, when the United Nations Intergovernmental
                     Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) first released
                     its definitive scientific assessment of
                     global warming, the base of evidence for
                     climate change has only grown. There is
                     now widespread consensus within the scientific
                     community that human activities-especially
                     the burning of fossil fuels-are the primary
                     driver of climate change. Since the beginning
                     of the 20th century, the earth has experienced
                     a rise in global temperatures. This warming
                     pattern is expected to continue, with the
                     IPCC projecting an increase of 1.4° to
                     5.8°C (2.5° to 10.4°F) within
                     the next 100 years. The shrinkage of glaciers,
                     declines of some plant and animal populations,
                     and earlier springtime emergence of insects
                     are only a few examples of the lasting impacts
                     already witnessed around the world. Beyond
                     the serious and potentially irreversible
                     effects on physical and biological systems
                     being observed, there is also a growing
                     body of research that suggests that global
                     climate change will adversely affect public
                     health....</span> </p>

                   Russia, Pollution Is Good for Business</a>,
                 By ANDREW E. KRAMER. <span>Excerpt:
                   MOSCOW, Dec. 24 - By its own admission, Russia's
                   electricity monopoly is the world's largest
                   corporate producer of greenhouse gases, accounting
                   - by itself - for nearly as much carbon dioxide
                   as is emitted by Britain. ...From smokestacks
                   across Russia's 11 time zones, the company,
                   Unified Energy Systems, spews out 2 percent
                   of all human-generated carbon dioxide accumulating
                   in the atmosphere. What will the utility get
                   for being the world's largest greenhouse gas
                   polluter? It is hoping for $1 billion. It is
                   one of the paradoxes of the Kyoto Protocol on
                   climate change that companies in Russia and
                   other Eastern European countries, which are
                   among the world's largest producers of greenhouse
                   gases, are poised to earn hundreds of millions
                   of dollars through trading their rights to release
                   carbon dioxide into the air. The Kyoto treaty,
                   negotiated in 1997 and adopted by 36 industrial
                   nations, ... requires the 36 industrial nations
                   - with varying targets - to reduce their emissions
                   of greenhouse gases below their 1990 levels,
                   in the five years from 2008 to 2012. For the
                   European Union, the target is to reduce emissions
                   to 8 percent below 1990 levels. In an indication
                   of how robust the demand for emissions credits
                   may be, this year the European Union is 6 percent
                   above its 1990 levels. The United States, which
                   generates a fifth of greenhouse gases but has
                   not joined the Kyoto Protocol, is 19 percent
                   above its theoretical limits. Russia, in contrast,
                   suffered an economic collapse in the 1990's,
                   and is 43 percent below its 1990 baseline in
                   the Kyoto agreement. In fact, Russia does not
                   expect to reach 1990's emissions levels until
                   around 2020 ...At the same time, Russian industry
                   is generally wasteful with energy...President
                   Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, citing

                   ANDREW C. REVKIN, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     MONTREAL, Dec. 6 - Under pressure from other
                     industrialized countries at talks here on
                     global warming, the Bush administration announced
                     on Tuesday that it had signed an agreement
                     with a coalition of energy companies to build
                     a prototype coal-burning power plant with
                     no emissions. ... a formal agreement had been
                     signed under which companies would contribute
                     $250 million of a cost estimated at $1 billion.
                     Environmental advocates at the talks criticized
                     the announcement, saying it was intended to
                     distract from continuing efforts by the American
                     delegation to block discussion of new international
                     commitments to cut emissions of carbon dioxide
                     and other heat-trapping gases that scientists
                     link to global warming. "You are watching
                     163 nations do an elaborate dance to try to
                     make progress when the United States is sitting
                     in the middle of the road trying to obstruct," said
                     Alden Meyer, a representative of the Union
                     of Concerned Scientists, a group that has
                     long criticized the Bush administration's
                     climate approach. "It's getting to be
                     like Charlie Brown with Lucy holding that
                     football," he said. 
                     "Every time, at the last minute, the
                     U.S. pulls it away."...While more than
                     150 countries have ratified the protocol,
                     only about three dozen industrialized ones
                     are subject to the binding terms. The world's
                     biggest emitter, the United States, has not
                     ratified it. And the fast-growing giants of
                     the developing world, China and India, continue
                     to insist that they will not accept cuts in
                     emissions.</span>

                     By ANDREW C. REVKIN. NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                       IN December 1997, representatives of most
                       of the world's nations met in Kyoto, Japan,
                       to negotiate a binding agreement to cut emissions
                       of "greenhouse" gases. They succeeded.
                       The Kyoto Protocol was ultimately ratified
                       by 156 countries.... Today, in the middle
                       of new global warming talks in Montreal, there
                       is a sense that the whole idea of global agreements
                       to cut greenhouse gases won't work. A major
                       reason the optimism over Kyoto has eroded
                       so rapidly is that its major requirement -
                       that 38 participating industrialized countries
                       cut their greenhouse emissions below 1990
                       levels by the year 2012 - was seen as just
                       a first step toward increasingly aggressive
                       cuts. But in the years after the protocol
                       was announced, developing countries, including
                       the fast-growing giants China and India, have
                       held firm on their insistence that they would
                       accept no emissions cuts, even though they
                       are likely to be the world's dominant source
                       of greenhouse gases in coming years. Their
                       refusal helped fuel strong opposition to the
                       treaty in the United States Senate and its
                       eventual rejection by President Bush....As
                       Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, a proponent
                       of emissions targets, said in a statement
                       on Nov. 1: "The blunt truth about the
                       politics of climate change is that no country
                       will want to sacrifice its economy in order
                       to meet this challenge."... the United
                       States - by far the world's largest producer
                       of greenhouse gases - continues to say that
                       emissions targets or requirements would stunt
                       economic growth in both rich and poor nations.</span>

                               in New York and eight other Northeastern states
                               have come to a preliminary agreement to freeze
                               power plant emissions at their current levels
                               and then reduce them by 10 percent by 2020,
                               according to a confidential draft proposal.
                               The cooperative action, the first of its kind
                               in the nation, came after the Bush administration
                               decided not to regulate the greenhouse gases

                               in higher energy prices in the nine states,
                               which officials hope can be offset by subsidies
                               and support for the development of new technology
                               that would be paid for with the proceeds from

                   Energy Corp. will push for a tax on carbon
                   dioxide emissions in order to combat climate
                   change, Chief Executive Officer Paul Anderson
                   said yesterday. Such a stance would run counter
                   to the Bush administration's position on addressing
                   CO2 emissions. Speaking in North Carolina
                   to business and civic leaders at a Charlotte
                   Business Journal event, Anderson said: "Personally,
                   I feel the time has come to act -- to take
                   steps as a nation to reduce the carbon intensity
                   of our economy." 
                   Anderson added, "Any actions must be
                   mandatory, economy-wide and federal in scope.
                   Anderson said he does not expect to see a
                   carbon tax enacted while President Bush is
                   still in office. "The next couple of
                   years are about getting the debate out in
                   the open and getting the sides lined up," 
                   he said. "I'm not going to get invited
                   to Exxon Mobil's Christmas party" (David
                   Mildenberg, Charlotte Business Journal, April
                   7)...." He added, "You can imagine
                   the reaction I get when I say 'carbon tax'
                   in the halls of Duke Energy. One employee
                   wrote me that as a shareholder, he couldn't
                   fathom why I would advocate a position that
                   would discourage use of our product by potentially
                   increasing its price." ...There has been
                   a steady increase in the number of companies
                   setting voluntary emission goals, analysts
                   said. While some companies are trying to hedge
                   their bets against future carbon regulations,
                   pressure from the financial community is also
                   a significant factor.</span>

                   Feelings as Treaty on Greenhouse Gases Takes
                   Effect</a>. By MARK LANDLER NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany. ... Mr. Strube, chairman
                     of BASF's [the world's largest chemical maker]
                     supervisory board, responds with a hint of
                     impatience when asked how European industry
                     plans to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, requiring
                     Germany and 34 other nations to cut their
                     emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
                     gases. As the agreement takes effect on Feb.
                     16, worries about its fairness are mixed with
                     mild resentment. Europeans have set some of
                     the most stringent targets for reducing greenhouse
                     gases, which trap heat in the earth's atmosphere
                     and have been linked by climate experts to
                     global warming. It is bad enough, in their
                     view, that American and Chinese companies
                     will not bear these extra costs. But worse,
                     the ultimate goal of curbing greenhouse gases
                     will not be realized because carbon dioxide
                     emissions, unlike polluted rivers, are a global
                     rather than a local problem. "We have
                     already done so much in the past that we feel
                     others should not get a free ride," 
                     Mr. Strube said. "We could reach a situation
                     where the leader is a lonely rider going into
                     the sunset, and everyone else sits back and
                     says, O.K., let's wait and see when he will
                     return."...The carbon market has developed
                     rapidly in Europe, with credits for six million
                     tons of carbon traded in January. (Each credit
                     represents a metric ton.) The price of a credit
                     fell 19 percent over the month, to about $9.
                     Carbon, like other energy markets, is affected
                     by the weather, with emissions rising when
                     it is colder. ... the trading system is considered
                     one of the Kyoto system's innovative features.
                     Recognizing that greenhouse gases are fungible
                     - emissions in China are no different from
                     those in Europe, and they all mix freely in
                     the atmosphere - it is an efficient way to
                     reduce the overall level by allowing less-polluting
                     companies to sell unused rights to emit.</span>

                     from NASA, other government agencies, academia
                     and industry will investigate cirrus clouds

                     uncertainties in forecasts of the Earth's
                     future climate. The project focuses on studies
                     of high, tropical cirrus clouds. These clouds
                     are composed of tiny ice crystals that float
                     at altitudes from 20,000 feet (6,067 meters)
                     to 55,000 feet (16,683 meters). Scientists
                     will take measurements from a variety of aircraft
                     and ground instruments for four to six weeks
                     beginning in July. Analysis and reporting
                     of the data are expected to take about two

                     have had their first inside look at ice layers,
                     frozen debris and a surprising channel of
                     water deep beneath an Antarctic ice stream,
                     thanks to an ice probe designed by NASA's
                     JPL. Plunged more than 1,200 meters (more
                     than 3,900 feet) down four boreholes drilled
                     in the West Antarctic ice sheet, JPL's probe
                     paves the way for the development of technology
                     capable of withstanding extreme environments
                     on Earth and other planets. The Antarctic
                     Ice Borehole Probe Project, a collaborative
                     effort of scientists at JPL and the California
                     Institute of Technology in Pasadena, looked
                     into the dynamics of the West Antarctic ice
                     sheet. The Antarctic ice sheet, equal in size
                     to the United States and Mexico combined,
                     holds a potential treasure trove of information
                     related to the geological history of this
                     frozen continent and the mechanisms by which
                     ice flows from this area to the oceans. Studies
                     show that significant changes in glacier melting
                     and flow rates could have a considerable impact
