<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2022-03-10. <strong>New insight into magma chambers could improve volcano models</strong>. By Colin Barras, Science Magazine. Excerpt: Researchers have discovered a simple and surprising control over the depth of a volcano’s magma chamber: how much water it contains. The finding is significant because water fuels the most devastating eruptions—from Vesuvius in 79 C.E. to Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The work could also help improve models that predict eruptions, which for years have been based on a volcano’s seismic rumblings and records of its past behavior. ...Daniel Rasmussen ...and his colleagues wanted to understand why magma chambers—slushy mixes of molten rock, solid crystals, and gases—lie anywhere between about 1 kilometer and 12 kilometers below the surface of “arc” volcanoes, a common kind of volcano that forms near the boundaries of tectonic plates. When plates of ocean crust slide into the mantle, the layer that makes up most of Earth’s interior, they drag water with them that gets locked away in minerals. This water then fuels the formation of magmas. As this magma rises through cracks and fissures, it is depressurized ...much like the bubbles in a popped can of carbonated soda. But magma also gets stickier as it loses water, and ...gradually becomes so thick it can rise no farther—at least until a physical disturbance such as an injection of extra magma drives an eruption. ...A magma body with 1% water by weight would begin to lose water just 1 kilometer below the surface, ...but for magma with 7% water by weight, loss would begin much deeper, at about 12 kilometers. This means, counterintuitively, that “wetter” magmas—even though they’re initially more fluid—thicken up and stall out at greater depths than “drier” ones. The researchers thought this could explain why magmas occur at different depths.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/new-insight-magma-chambers-could-improve-volcano-models">https://www.science.org/content/article/new-insight-magma-chambers-could-improve-volcano-models</a>] For GSS Energy Flow chapter 2.</p>

Excerpt: When snowstorms hit,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.epa.gov/snep/winter-coming-and-it-tons-salt-our-roads" target="_blank">deicing agents</a>&nbsp;such as road salts and brine help keep streets and walkways open.

Links between elevated sodium intake and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/sodium.htm" target="_blank">human health risks</a>, such as high blood pressure, are well established. The effects of deicers on drinking water, however, have been less clear. Now, evidence reported by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GH000538" target="_blank"><em>Cruz et al.</em></a>&nbsp;supports a link between deicers and elevated sodium levels in drinking water, with concentrations in the Philadelphia region sometimes surpassing recommended limits for people on sodium-restricted diets.

By <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/henry-fountain">Henry Fountain</a>, The New York Times. Excerpt: The Amazon is losing its ability to recover from disturbances like droughts and land-use changes, scientists reported Monday, adding to concern that the rainforest is approaching a critical threshold beyond which much of it will be replaced by grassland, with vast consequences for biodiversity and climate change. The scientists said their research did not pinpoint when this threshold, which they described as a tipping point, might be reached. “But it’s worth reminding ourselves that if it gets to that tipping point, that we commit to losing the Amazon rainforest, then we get a significant feedback to global climate change,” said one of the scientists, Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter in England. Losing the rainforest could result in up to 90 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide getting put back into the atmosphere, he said, equivalent to several years of global emissions. That would make limiting global warming more difficult.… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/climate/amazon-rainforest-climate-change-deforestation.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/climate/amazon-rainforest-climate-change-deforestation.html</a>] For GSS A New World View chapter 5.</p>

By <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/coral-davenport">Coral Davenport</a>, The New York Times. Excerpt: The Biden administration on Monday proposed strict new limits on pollution from buses, delivery vans, tractor-trailers and other heavy trucks — the first time in more than 20 years that tailpipe standards have been tightened for the biggest polluters on the road. The new draft rule from the Environmental Protection Agency would require heavy-duty trucks to reduce emissions of nitrogen dioxide by 90 percent by 2031. Nitrogen dioxide is linked to lung cancer, heart disease and premature death. The E.P.A. also announced plans to slightly tighten truck emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is driving climate change. The new rules for nitrogen oxide pollution would apply to trucks beginning with the model year 2027, while the carbon dioxide rules would apply to trucks starting with the model year 2024.… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/climate/trucks-pollution-rules-epa.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/climate/trucks-pollution-rules-epa.html</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 9 and Climate Change chapter 9.</p>

In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.greenamerica.org/native-growers-decolonize-regenerative-agriculture">Indigenous communities</a>&nbsp;have farmed in nature’s image for millennia. “The regenerative agriculture movement is the dawning realization among more people that an Indigenous approach to agriculture can help restore ecologies, fight climate change, rebuild relationships, spark economic development, and bring joy,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/arohi-sharma">Arohi Sharma</a>, water and agriculture policy analyst at NRDC.&nbsp;...“When we speak with farmers and ranchers focused on regenerative agriculture, they tell us that their notion of ‘success’ goes beyond yield and farm size,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/lara-bryant">Lara Bryant</a>, deputy director of water and agriculture at NRDC. “It includes things like joy and happiness, the number of families they feed, watching how the land regenerates and flourishes, the money saved from not purchasing chemical inputs, the debt avoided by repurposing old equipment, and the relationships built with community members.”&nbsp;...when we took animals out of cropping systems (a practice that started with poultry in the 1950s and expanded to beef and pork in the ’60s) and separated them into confined facilities and feedlots, we introduced a host of ethical and ecological problems, including the rise in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/industrial-agriculture-101#impacts">antibiotic-resistant bacteria</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/freshwater-harmful-algal-blooms-101">harmful algal blooms</a>.

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2022-01-04. <strong>These homes are off-grid and climate resilient. They’re also built out of trash</strong>. By Nick Aspinwall, The Washington Post. Excerpt:  Earthships originally spawned from the arid climate of Taos, maximizing abundant sunlight while squeezing whatever they can from about eight inches of annual rainfall. Each Earthship shares a set of core organs such as a water organization module, which filters and separates water as it moves throughout the house. In the Earthship ecosystem, water is first used for drinking, showering and hand washing before moving to interior plants, such as fig and banana trees, along with hanging gardens of herbs and flowers. The resulting “gray water” is used to fertilize ornamental outdoor plants and can be safely released into the groundwater supply or used in the toilet, from which “black water” is flushed into a septic tank. ...Another module controls solar power, which is used primarily for lights and appliances. Earthships use about one-sixth as much power as a conventional house. “You take care of it, it’ll take care of you,” Albury said. “It’s very symbiotic.” A typical Earthship can produce 25 to 50 percent of the food its residents need, .… [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/01/04/earthship-houses-climate-change/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/01/04/earthship-houses-climate-change/</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 10.</p>

Excerpt: ...The study...surveyed eagles in 38 states, whereas previous work focused on a single region or just a handful of states. ...Bald eagles (<em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em>) were close to extinction by the 1960s thanks in part to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). The pesticide washed into waterways, contaminated the fish the eagles ate, and poisoned the birds, weakening their eggshells and killing hatchlings. After DDT was banned in 1972, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 protected bald eagle habitat, population numbers started to tick up.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/pdf/management/bald-eagle-population-size-2020.pdf">There are more than 300,000 bald eagles alive in the wild today</a>. ...When an eagle eats lead—usually in the form of ammunition left behind in deer and other carcasses—it shows up in the bloodstream, filters through the liver, and can build up in the bones if the bird eats enough lead throughout its lifetime.  ...Models comparing natural and lead-caused deaths revealed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj3068?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D74931250225030487362748334309947665578%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1645104801&amp;_ga=2.172694307.1053541419.1644941504-573798470.1601955111&amp;adobe_mc=MCMID%3D09550757626343302913437232586634767807%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1645426365">lead levels would stunt annual population growth by 3.8% in bald eagles and 0.8% in golden eagles</a>&nbsp;each year, the team reports today at the annual meeting of AAAS (which publishes&nbsp;Science) and online today in&nbsp;Science.

Excerpt: OBERWÖLZ, Austria — At the Lachtal ski resort, high in the eastern Alps of Austria, skiers immediately pull out their phones after sliding off the chairlift — not to take selfies, but rather to snap pictures of the windmills that have become part of the mountainous vista. When the first windmills were built here in 2002, at about 7,290 feet, many tourists saw the massive blades as an eyesore. But as the wind park grew and expanded, so did skiers’ environmental conscience. Today, locals and tourists are proud to ski among the backdrop. “When I ride up with them and eavesdrop, they’re usually impressed,” says Rudolf Wiesnegger, who maintains the wind park and adjacent solar panels. “They comment that it’s great for the environment,” he says. ...Skiers and spectators have been flabbergasted by this year’s Winter Olympics in Beijing.

Excerpt: Some 280 million years ago, before the rise of the Rocky Mountains—or even the dinosaurs—a 2.5-kilometer-wide asteroid smashed into the supercontinent of Pangaea, near the eastern border of present-day Wyoming. The impact’s heat and shock wave would have killed anything within 400 kilometers, making it one of the largest asteroid strikes in North American history. ...And there the crater may sit, kilometers down, even to this day. That’s the scenario painted in new work. Researchers haven’t found the crater itself, but they have identified a series of 31 smaller craters, each no wider than a U.S. football field. These “secondary” craters would have been formed by boulders ejected by the impact, landing up to 200 kilometers away. It is the first time a secondary crater field—commonly seen on other planetary bodies, including the Moon—has been discovered on Earth. ...The craters’ pattern was similar to the rays and streaks of small craters that surround large craters on the Moon, like Tycho.

Excerpt: ...NASA’s Perseverance rover ...On Feb. 18 last year, the spacecraft carrying the rover pierced the Martian atmosphere at 13,000 miles per hour. ...Twelve months later, Perseverance is nestled within&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/science/nasa-jezero-perseverance.html">a 28-mile-wide crater known as Jezero</a>. From the topography, it is evident that more than three billion years ago, Jezero was a body of water roughly the size of Lake Tahoe, with rivers flowing in from the west and out to the east. One of the first things Perseverance did was deploy Ingenuity, a small robotic helicopter and the first such flying machine to take off on another planet. Perseverance also demonstrated a technology for generating oxygen that will be crucial whenever astronauts finally make it to Mars. The rover then set off on a diversion from the original exploration plans, to study the floor of the crater it landed in. ...collect cores of rock — cylinders about the size of sticks of chalk — that are eventually to be brought back to Earth by a future mission [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/science/mars-sample-return-mission.html">Mars Sample Return</a>].  ...data confirm that what orbital images suggested was a river delta is indeed that and that the history of water here was complex. The boulders, which almost certainly came from the surrounding highlands, point to episodes of violent flooding at Jezero. ...On April 18 last year, Ingenuity rose to a height of 10 feet, hovered for 30 seconds, and then descended back to the ground.

And as concerns grow about how tailpipe emissions are heating the planet, Colorado is among a handful of car-dominated states that are rethinking road building. In December, Colorado&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.codot.gov/programs/environmental/greenhousegas" target="_blank">adopted a first-of-its-kind climate change regulation</a>&nbsp;that will push transportation planners to redirect funding away from highway expansions and toward projects that cut vehicle pollution, such as buses and bike lanes. ...In 2019, states spent one-third of their highway dollars on new road capacity,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2019/sf12a.cfm" target="_blank">roughly $19.3 billion</a>, with the rest spent on repairs.  “This is a major blind spot for politicians who say they care about climate change,” said Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the Center for American Progress.... “Everyone gets that oil pipelines are carbon infrastructure. But new highways are carbon infrastructure, too. Both lock in place 40 to 50 years of emissions.” The core problem, environmentalists say, is a phenomenon known as “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf" target="_blank">induced traffic demand</a>.” When states build new roads or add lanes to congested highways, instead of reducing traffic, more cars show up to fill the available space.

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2022-02-09. <strong>An electric jolt salvages valuable metals from waste</strong>. By Sam Kean, Science Magazine. Excerpt: As chemists scramble to find ways to reclaim valuable metals from industrial waste and discarded electronics, one team has found a solution that sounds a little like magic: Zap the trash with flashes of electric heat. Rare earth elements (REEs) present an environmental paradox. On one hand, these dozen or so metals, such as yttrium and neodymium, are vital components of wind turbines and solar panels, and cheap sources of REEs could give those green technologies a huge boost. On the other, mining REEs causes billions of dollars of environmental damage each year. ...mining companies have to chew through tons upon tons of ore, stripping and gutting landscapes. ...Old electronics and other industrial waste, in contrast, are rich in REEs. But existing recycling methods are inefficient and expensive, and require corrosive chemicals such as concentrated hydrochloric acid. The new process could help break that logjam. Today in&nbsp;Science Advances, a team led by organic chemist James Tour of Rice University reports&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/SCIADV.ABM3132" target="_blank">using pulses of electrical heat to make it easier to extract REEs from industrial waste</a>. The technique is roughly twice as efficient as current methods and uses far more benign chemicals. ...In addition to fly ash, Tour’s team has extracted REEs from so-called red mud—a byproduct of making aluminum—and from electronics. In the latter case, the team gutted an old laptop and ground its circuit board into powder to experiment with.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/electric-jolt-salvages-valuable-metals-waste">https://www.science.org/content/article/electric-jolt-salvages-valuable-metals-waste</a>] For GSS Ecosystem Change chapter 7.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2022-02-09. <strong>European fusion reactor sets record for sustained energy</strong>. Daniel Clery, Science Magazine. Excerpt: In experiments culminating the 40-year run of the Joint European Torus (JET), the world’s largest fusion reactor, researchers announced today they have smashed the record for producing controlled fusion energy.&nbsp;On 21 December 2021, the U.K.-based JET heated a gas of hydrogen isotopes to 150 million degrees Celsius and held it steady for 5 seconds while nuclei fused together, releasing 59 megajoules (MJ) of energy—roughly twice the kinetic energy of a fully laden semitrailer truck traveling at 160 kilometers per hour. The energy in the pulse is more than 2.5 times the previous record of 22 MJ, set by JET 25 years earlier. “To see shots in which it sustains high power for a full 5 seconds is amazing,” says Steven Cowley, director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). JET’s achievement doesn’t mean fusion-generated electricity will flow into the grid anytime soon, however. Researchers had to put roughly three times as much energy into the gas as the reaction produced. But the result gives them confidence in the design of ITER, a giant fusion reactor under construction in France, which is supposed to pump out at least 10 times as much energy as is fed in. “This is very good news for ITER,” says Alberto Loarte, head of ITER’s science division. “It strongly confirms our strategy.”.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/european-fusion-reactor-sets-record-sustained-energy">https://www.science.org/content/article/european-fusion-reactor-sets-record-sustained-energy</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 4.</p>

Excerpt:  Over the past three years, SpaceX has deployed thousands of satellites into low-Earth orbit as part of its business to beam high-speed internet service from space. But the company’s latest deployment of 49 new satellites after a Feb. 3 launch did not go as planned. As a consequence of a geomagnetic storm triggered by a recent outburst of the sun, up to 40 of 49 newly launched Starlink satellites have been knocked out of commission. They are in the process of re-entering Earth’s atmosphere, where they will be incinerated. ...The sun has an 11-year-long cycle in which it oscillates between hyperactive and quiescent states. Presently, it is ramping up to its peak, which has been forecast to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-sun-is-getting-stormier-just-in-time-for-a-total-solar-eclipse" target="_blank">arrive around 2025</a>.

By&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://eos.org/author/k-m-s-cartier">Kimberly M. S. Cartier</a></strong>, Eos/AGU. Excerpt: When carbon mineralizes in stone, each new fracture exposes more surfaces that can react with and trap CO<sub>2</sub>, enhancing a rock’s storage capacity.  As concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) continue to rise and drive climate change, scientists have been researching options not just to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions but also to actually remove carbon from the atmosphere. Many carbon capture and storage methods seek to trap gaseous or water-dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;in underground storage reservoirs, but these could leak and release greenhouse gas back into the atmosphere. “When you inject CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>in a gas form, it can escape, for example, if a fault is moving or there is damage to the reservoir. It is always going to be looking for a way to escape to an area where the pressure is lower,” explained&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.catalina-sanchez-roa.com/" target="_blank">Catalina Sanchez-Roa</a>, an experimental geophysicist at Columbia University Climate School in New York City. “But with carbon mineralization, you [store] it as a mineral, as a solid, and then it’s very stably stored for a really long period of time.”.… [<a href="https://eos.org/articles/good-news-rocks-crack-under-pressure-from-mineral-co2-storage">https://eos.org/articles/good-news-rocks-crack-under-pressure-from-mineral-co2-storage</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 10.</p>

The killing of more than 500 wolves in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming in recent months...threatens to undermine a decades-old effort to restore the predators to the landscape and disrupt&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.347.6228.1302">a long-term Yellowstone research project that has produced influential findings on how wolves help shape ecosystems.</a> Researchers and conservation groups are calling on government officials to rethink the hunts, which have eliminated about 16% of the wolves living in the three states. ...The killings are the result of a change in legal protections for&nbsp;<em>Canis lupus</em>. For decades, the wolves were strictly protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), but more than 10 years ago successful restoration efforts prompted federal officials to ease protections and give state governments a greater say in managing the species. ...several states have legalized or expanded wolf hunts.

Excerpt: ...the forest is hiding a toxic secret: It is tainted by mercury at levels as high as those found in industrial regions in China, according to new research. The mercury is the product of hundreds of illegal, small-scale gold mines, and is leaving its poisonous fingerprint in forest wildlife. “These forests … are receiving an enormous load of mercury, and the mercury is indeed entering into the food web,” says biogeochemist Jackie Gerson, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the research as a Ph.D. student at Duke University. The new study, the first to describe such effects anywhere in the world, is another strand in the growing web of evidence that connects mining to mercury pollution in rivers, fish, and forests. Gold mining has recently outstripped coal burning as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/global-mercury-assessment-2018">world’s single largest source</a>&nbsp;of airborne mercury pollution, annually releasing as much as 1000 tons of the potent brain and reproductive poison into the atmosphere.

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2022-01-21. <strong>From River to Sea: Estimating Wood Cascades</strong>. By&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://eos.org/author/c-wilke">Carolyn Wilke</a></strong>, Eos/AGU. Excerpt: Dead wood might sound like it belongs in a garbage dump, but it’s a boon to the world’s rivers, beaches, and oceans, where it fuels ecosystem diversity. Until now, scientists have lacked an estimate for how much wood flows through rivers and out to sea. But according to a study&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj0988" target="_blank">reported in&nbsp;<em>Science Advances</em></a>, some 4.7 million cubic meters of wood may enter the oceans every year as a result of natural process such as erosion and storms. And that amount—almost twice the volume of the Great Pyramid of Giza—may pale in comparison to the wood cascades of the preindustrial past. ...Before the 1970s, many people thought that the dead wood of old-growth forests was just debris, said&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sites.warnercnr.colostate.edu/fluvial-geomorphology/people/34-2/" target="_blank">Ellen Wohl</a>, a geologist at Colorado State University and one of the authors of the new study. But in the late 1970s, a whole-ecosystem study in the Pacific Northwest started a revolution in how people think about dead wood, she said. ...Early history may have seen vastly more wood reach the ocean, the authors say. Nowadays, dams cut off river flow and, by extension, the transport of dead wood. People remove wood from waterways for flood control, as well as from harbors, estuaries, and beaches. Plus, deforestation has decreased global tree cover, leading to less wood inputs to the oceans. All of these changes raise the question, What impacts does dead wood’s removal have on coastal, open ocean, and deep-sea ecosystems?.… [<a href="https://eos.org/articles/from-river-to-sea-estimating-wood-cascades">https://eos.org/articles/from-river-to-sea-estimating-wood-cascades</a>] For GSS Ecosystem Change chapter 1.</p>

Excerpt: ...Twenty-five hundred years of maritime living have shaped the culture and identity of the people of the Maldives, a country of 1,196 low-lying islands arranged into a double chain of 26 coral atolls, so flat they scarcely breach the horizon. ...the Maldives may become the first country on Earth to disappear beneath rising seas. ...Now, as the pace of climate change accelerates, this tiny nation is trying to buy time, in hopes that the world’s leaders will reduce carbon emissions before the Maldives’ inevitable demise. The archipelago has bet its future—along with a substantial sum from the national purse—on construction of an artificial, elevated island that could house a majority of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/maldives-population/" target="_blank">population&nbsp;of&nbsp;</a>nearly 555,000 people.

(The list of “disappeared islands” of the Maldives is long.) Most of the islands—including the capital Malé—stand about 3.5 feet above sea level; climate scientists forecast they will be inundated by the century’s end.

Excerpt: Gas-burning stoves in kitchens across America may pose a greater risk to the planet and public health than previously thought, new research suggests. The appliances release far more of the potent planet-warming gas methane than the Environmental Protection Agency estimates, Stanford University scientists<strong>&nbsp;</strong>found in a study published Thursday in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. The appliances also emit significant amounts of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant that can trigger asthma and other respiratory conditions.

By&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/joel-achenbach/">Joel Achenbach</a>, The Washington Post. Excerpt: NASA’s long-delayed, $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble, has been cruising for a month, deploying a vast sun shield and 18 gold-plated mirrors while overcoming a long list of potential snags. It will study the evolution of galaxies and provide new looks at worlds in our own solar system. ...The final course correction, the third engine burn since launch, placed the Webb in a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2022/01/21/lagrange-point-explainer-webb-telescope/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4" target="_blank">gravitationally stable position known as L2</a>, where it will always be roughly 1 million miles from Earth on the opposite side of our planet from the sun. ...the launch itself and two subsequent engine burns were so efficient that the Webb did not expend very much fuel to get where it is going.

Excerpt: ...For eight years, scientists have been considering that Mimas, seemingly a pockmarked ball of ice frozen hard, might be hiding a secret: an ocean flowing 14 to 20 miles below the surface. In recent years, such ocean worlds —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/science/europa-plumes-water.html">Europa at Jupiter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/science/saturn-cassini-moon-enceladus.html">Enceladus at Saturn</a>, to name two — have jumped to the top of the lists for scientists who are considering places in the solar system where life could have arisen.

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2022-01-17. <strong>Mars rover detects carbon signature that hints at past life source</strong>. By Paul Voosen, Science Magazine. Excerpt: Since 2012, NASA’s Curiosity rover has trundled across Mars, drilling into rocks and running the grit through a sophisticated onboard chemistry lab, aiming to tease out evidence for life. Today, a team of rover scientists announced an intriguing signal, one that may or may not be evidence of past life, but is, at the very least, surprisingly weird. The team found that the carbon trapped in a handful of rocks probed by the rover is dramatically enriched in light isotopes of carbon. On Earth, the signal would be seen as strong evidence for ancient microbial life. Given that this is Mars, however, the researchers are reluctant to make any grand claims, and they have worked hard to concoct alternative, nonbiological explanations involving ultraviolet (UV) light and stardust. But those alternatives are at least as far-fetched as a scenario in which subterranean microbes emitted the enriched carbon as methane gas. The team concludes the study does “inch up the plausibility” that microbes once existed on the planet—and could still today, says Christopher House, a biogeochemist at Pennsylvania State University, University Park, and lead author of the study, which was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115651119">published today</a>in the&nbsp;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/mars-rover-detects-carbon-signature-hints-past-life-source">https://www.science.org/content/article/mars-rover-detects-carbon-signature-hints-past-life-source</a>] For GSS A Changing Cosmos chapter 7.</p>

Excerpt: In the third millennium B.C.E., a strange group of donkeylike creatures was buried alongside royals in an ancient city east of what is now Aleppo, Syria. Archaeologists reckoned the animals were “kungas,” a rare type of ass highly prized by Bronze Age Mesopotamian elites. Yet their true biological identity has remained a mystery. ...The genetic material in the skeletons was poorly preserved after thousands of years baking in the Syrian desert. ...So the team used highly sensitive sequencing methods to analyze nuclear DNA from the remains, while also looking at regions from the animal’s maternal and paternal lineages. They compared the possible kunga DNA to the genomes of other equids, including modern horses, domestic donkeys, and the extinct Syrian wild ass. The bones weren’t from a single species of equid, the researchers report today in&nbsp;Science Advances. Rather, the animal was&nbsp;<a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm0218?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D09550757626343302913437232586634767807%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1642873989">the first generation offspring of two species, a female domestic donkey and a male Syrian wild ass</a>. ...this is the first documented example of a half-wild, half-domesticated animal.

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2021-12-08. <strong>Hydrogen-powered ferry to debut in San Francisco</strong>. By Ben Tracy, CBS News. Excerpt: For more than a century, residents have traveled around San Francisco Bay with ferry boats powered mostly by diesel — a planet-warming fossil fuel. But now, the world's first hydrogen-powered passenger ferry, which produces zero emissions, is launching in the bay.&nbsp; "Instead of a big diesel engine spinning things to make power ... [it] just happens here in the fuel cells," said Jeff Sokolik, who works for All American Marine, the Bellingham, Washington, company that built the 75-passenger catamaran.&nbsp;"When you actually use hydrogen to create electricity, the only byproduct is literally hot water, so it's zero emissions and completely clean," said Ron Willie, the president of the company.  The marine-based shipping industry, mostly international shipping, is one of the dirty and not so little secrets of climate change. It causes about 3% of all global carbon dioxide gas emissions, which is more than the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the airline industry. A much larger hydrogen-powered ferry is now being built in Europe, and the technology could eventually be applied to container ships. But there is a downside: if hydrogen leaks during production or from its tanks, it contributes to global warming. "There's a lot of hope and promise around it, but in order for it to really move forward — in order for the climate to be protected, we need to understand what the leak potential really is," said Amanda Leland, the executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund.… [<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hydrogen-powered-ferry-to-debut-in-san-francisco/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hydrogen-powered-ferry-to-debut-in-san-francisco/</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 9.</p>

Excerpt: As the drought has deepened in the state, growers have turned to groundwater, resulting in severe overdraft in many areas—particularly the San Joaquin Valley. That led to the passage of the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), which required the identification of the state’s overdrawn and at-risk basins, quantification of their yields, and the development of pumping plans that achieve sustainability within 20 years of being implemented.&nbsp;...Almond trees are only commercially productive for about 20 years, and his groundwater plan means replacement trees won’t be planted in many areas. Instead, Woolf will concentrate on growing tomatoes for processing, as well as pistachios, which are longer-lived and less thirsty than&nbsp;almonds. ...Woolf is also experimenting with alternative crops—specifically, drought-tolerant ones like agave, the feedstock for products like tequila and mezcal. “The ultimate goal would be to distill and market spirits ourselves, under our own brand,” he&nbsp;says. ...And there’s a new crop on the horizon: energy. Rather than asking his plants to turn sunlight into calories, as farmers always have, Woolf plans to harvest sunlight directly. He’ll ultimately convert 3,500 acres of former cropland to solar installation, and many other growers are doing the same: Large photovoltaic arrays are popping up all across the&nbsp;valley.… [<a href="https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/winter-2021/water-runs-low-san-joaquin-valley-adapts-drier-future">https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/winter-2021/water-runs-low-san-joaquin-valley-adapts-drier-future</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 8.</p>

Excerpt: With the Arctic warming up to four times faster than the global average, temperatures in the frozen soil, or permafrost, under northern Siberia have been rising, turning firm ground unstable and weakening foundations. On 29 May 2020, the thaw may have helped lead to a disaster, when a diesel fuel depot near the town of Norilsk collapsed and spilled more than 21,000 tons of fuel into a small river. The pollution turned the river rusty-red and ultimately reached the Arctic Ocean. The owner of the fuel depot, Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest miner of nickel and palladium, was fined almost $2 billion for the spill—the largest settlement for an environmental disaster in Russian history. Now, the disaster has spurred the government to set up the first national system to monitor Russia’s permafrost—the world’s largest expanse of frozen soil, covering two-thirds of the nation. In October, President Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead to a new $21 million system of 140 monitoring stations that could begin to deliver data as soon as 2023. Sensors placed in boreholes up to 30 meters deep will measure the temperature of permafrost at various depths, a critical parameter for tracking both the growing hazard thawing ground poses to infrastructure and the broader climate threat: that the thaw could release billions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/russia-s-new-permafrost-monitoring-system-could-improve-climate-models-protect">https://www.science.org/content/article/russia-s-new-permafrost-monitoring-system-could-improve-climate-models-protect</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 10.</p>

Excerpt: Astronomers have long thought it takes millions of years for the seeds of stars like the Sun to come together. Clouds of mostly hydrogen gas coalesce under gravity into prestellar cores dense enough to collapse and spark nuclear fusion, while magnetic forces hold matter in place and slow down the process. But observations using the world’s largest radio telescope are casting doubt on this long gestational period. Researchers have zoomed in on a prestellar core in a giant gas cloud—a nursery for hundreds of baby stars—and found the tiny embryo may be forming 10 times faster than thought, thanks to weak magnetic fields. “If this is proven to be the case in other gas clouds, it will be revolutionary for the star formation community,” says Paola Caselli from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, who was not involved with the research.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/stars-may-form-10-times-faster-thought">https://www.science.org/content/article/stars-may-form-10-times-faster-thought</a>] For GSS A Changing Cosmos chapter 7.</p>

Excerpt: MARTIN COUNTY, Ky. — In Martin County, Ky., where coal production has flatlined, entrepreneurs are promising that a new solar farm atop a shuttered mine will bring green energy jobs. ...For a mountain that’s had its top blown off, the old Martiki coal mine is looking especially winsome these days. With its vast stretches of emerald grass dotted with hay bales and ringed with blue-tinged peaks, and the wild horses and cattle that roam there, it looks less like a shuttered strip mine and more like an ad for organic milk. The mountain is poised for another transformation. Hundreds of acres are set to be blanketed with solar panels in the coming year, installed by locals, many of them former miners. The $231 million project, which recently cleared its last regulatory hurdle, may well be the biggest utility-scale coal to solar project in the country.… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/climate/coal-mines-solar-climate.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/climate/coal-mines-solar-climate.html</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 10.</p>

By&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/michael-birnbaum/">Michael Birnbaum</a>, The Washington Post. Excerpt: [Richard] Nugee was a three-star general at the peak of his career, after a long string of deployments in the world’s conflict zones, including Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan. ...in the final fight of his military life, he decided to take on one of the wiliest adversaries: climate change. Militaries are both enormous emitters and facing fearsome new conflicts sparked by global warming. Nugee resolved to fight a lonely battle to address both problems.  ...Fighting a war burns prodigious quantities of fossil fuels. The Pentagon, by some counts, is the world’s largest institutional consumer of oil. ...He assembled a step-by-step plan to slash military emissions and prepare the armed forces for a hotter planet. Wars may be fought over access to water. Millions could be forced to migrate because of extreme weather. Emboldened rivals such as China and Russia are already starting to plow their warships across the melting Arctic. The strategy was published earlier this year. “This is not doing it for moral reasons. This is not doing it because it’s about emissions. It’s about our own capability, it’s about our ability to be the most successful and the most credible force that we can,” Nugee said in Glasgow, where he was one of few with a military background amid the galaxy of people trying to fight for a cooler planet.… [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2021/climate-change-military-emissions-security/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2021/climate-change-military-emissions-security/</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 10.</p>

Some 30 minutes after launch, the telescope detached from the top of its Ariane 5 rocket and deployed its solar array, which is needed to charge its batteries and support communication with Earth. Webb is now en route to its observing station, a gravitational balance point known as L2 at 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. Before it gets there, mission controllers will have a tense month, as they unfurl parts of the telescope too large to fit inside the rocket fairing, including its tennis court–size sunshield and 6.5-meter-wide mirror.

Excerpt: Scientists and policymakers are puzzling over how to get rid of a group of toxic chemicals found in streams and drinking water. One hope was that the persistent compounds, known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), would flow out to sea and stay put. But the ocean, it turns out, is spitting them back out: A new study finds sea spray from waves is tossing PFAS into the atmosphere. ...<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/scientists-call-limits-emerging-class-common-long-lived-chemicals">PFAS</a>&nbsp;are found in everything from nonstick cookware to firefighting foam. ...But the strong chemical bonds that make PFAS so useful also make them extremely hard to break down, earning them the moniker “forever chemicals.” Lab studies have shown PFAS can damage the livers and immune systems of animals, and lead to birth defects and death. In humans, they’ve been linked to cancer and lower birth weights. ...Researchers have known the mist created by breaking waves can transport pollutants from the ocean into the atmosphere, says Matthew Salter, a marine biogeochemist at Stockholm University. The white, foamy bubbles don’t just contain air—they also contain microscopic droplets of chemicals that float to the surface of the water. ...Salter and colleagues collected air samples every few days from 2018 to 2020 at two monitoring sites.... ...Back in the lab, they analyzed the levels of PFAS and sodium ions, a key part of sea spray aerosol, in their samples. The amount of PFAS in the samples was closely linked to sodium levels—<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.1c04277">a sign that they both got into the air via sea spray</a>—the team reports this month in&nbsp;Environmental Science &amp; Technology.

The German government wants to shut them down. ...“For the first time in decades,” Macron said in the televised speech, France “will relaunch the construction of nuclear reactors.” Fessenheim had just begun to come to terms with the closure of its nuclear plant last year, in what the government had said was a “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/societe/nucleaire/fessenheim-le-premier-reacteur-de-la-plus-vieille-centrale-nucleaire-de-france-sera-arrete-samedi_3832207.html" target="_blank">first step</a>” in a “rebalancing” of energy sources. But while Macron remains committed to increasing investments in wind and solar energy, and to putting an end to the burning of coal, his remarks in November confirmed that France isn’t giving up on nuclear technology, its primary source of energy. ...The new German economy and climate minister, Green party member Robert Habeck, was&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://europeangreens.eu/news/closure-fessenheim-power-plant-energy-transition-will-be-nuclear-free" target="_blank">among the politicians who signed</a>&nbsp;a statement celebrating the closure of the Fessenheim plant.

The buzz was not because of a stylish aesthetic or historical significance, but rather the contrast between the truck’s retro looks and its very modern electric motor. Anyone can buy the motor, known as the Eluminator e-Crate, for $3,900, but the pickup is a one-off. It was custom built to show enthusiasts they too can turn geriatric gas-guzzlers into efficient machines. Customers can buy it “to put in whatever car they want to build,” said Mark Rushbrook, global director of Ford performance motorsports. “Classic Mustangs or a Galaxy or F series truck — they can buy the motor and install it.” ...In 2019, General Motors tucked a 450-horsepower motor and other components from its Bolt E.V. inside a 1962 C-10 pickup; in 2020, General Motors put the e-crate it is developing into a 1977 K-5 Blazer. ...In London, where drivers of older gasoline-powered cars pay extra to drive in certain parts of the city,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.londonelectriccars.com/" target="_blank">London Electric Cars</a> ...keeps busy modifying cars that are 20 years or older with electric motors it buys from salvage yards. “Last year we finished an old school Mini.

By&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/sarah-kaplan/">Sarah Kaplan</a>, The Washington Post. Excerpt: The ice shelf was cracking up. Surveys showed warm ocean water eroding its underbelly. Satellite imagery revealed long, parallel fissures in the frozen expanse, like scratches from some clawed monster. ...While other parts of the infamous Thwaites Glacier crumbled, this wedge of floating ice acted as a brace, slowing the melt. It was supposed to be boring, durable, safe. Now climate change has turned the ice shelf into a threat — to Pettit’s field work, and to the world. Planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels and other human activities has already raised global temperatures more than 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit). But the effects are particularly profound at the poles, where rising temperatures have seriously undermined regions once locked in ice.

Excerpt: Climate change is wreaking havoc on Pacific Ocean salmon populations: overheating spawning streams, triggering storms that scour stream beds and droughts that dry them up, and upending food webs in the Pacific. But a warming world could bring one silver lining, at least for a while. A new computer model shows retreating glaciers in British Columbia and Alaska could open up thousands of kilometers of new river habitat by 2100. ...Today in&nbsp;Nature Communications, they report that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26897-2">Pacific salmon river habitat will likely expand by 6150 kilometers</a>, nearly the length of the Mississippi River.&nbsp;This habitat consists primarily of streams with an incline of less than 10%, which makes it possible for fish to traverse; 2000 kilometers of the new river habitat is expected to be suitable for spawning and rearing young. In the Gulf of Alaska alone, melting glaciers are expected to increase salmon habitat by as much as 27%. The outlook isn’t all good. The region is home to rich deposits of gold and copper. Mining companies are racing to stake claims in territory that was previously buried under ice.&nbsp;...Good times for the fish that do colonize new rivers likely won’t last.

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2021-12-02. <strong>Germany’s trees are dying. A fierce debate has broken out over how to respond</strong>. By Gabriel Popkin, Science Magazine. Excerpt: ...During January 2018, ...a powerful storm felled many of the trees. Then, over the next 3 years, a record drought hit Germany and much of Central Europe, stressing the spruces that still stood. The back-to-back disasters enabled bark-boring beetles that had been munching on dead trees to jump to drought-weakened ones. Beetle populations exploded. In just 3 weeks, towering spruces that had seemed healthy were dead. ...All sides agree the recent die-off highlights the climate change threat. “It’s kind of an early warning, … a signal of what may still come,” says forest researcher Gert-Jan Nabuurs of Wageningen University &amp; Research. ...Most also agree that existing monocultures, so important to European forestry’s past, cannot ensure its future. “It’s a clear signal to the wood industry that you have to change the utilization from Norway spruce to other species,” Bolte says. The consensus breaks down, however, when it comes to solutions. For some, the dieback offers a rare chance to dramatically shift forest policy toward a more hands-off approach. Allowing devastated forests to naturally regrow, the thinking goes, could revitalize ecosystems and start to reverse centuries of biodiversity decline. ...To reduce the risks, some experts argue forest owners need to strategically plant new, more resilient tree varieties. Hints about strong candidates could come from a 250-hectare arboretum founded in the late 1800s in Wuppertal, a hilly town in western Germany. Here, collectors planted some 200 tree species from all over the world. More than 100 of those species are still growing, offering a rare opportunity to assess how the mature trees are handling climate change.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/germany-s-trees-are-dying-fierce-debate-has-broken-out-over-how-respond">https://www.science.org/content/article/germany-s-trees-are-dying-fierce-debate-has-broken-out-over-how-respond</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 8.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2021-11-29. <strong>How one society rebounded from ‘the worst year to be alive’</strong>. By Michael Price, Science Magazine. Excerpt: It was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-536-was-worst-year-be-alive">the worst time to be alive</a>, according to some scientists. From 536 C.E. to 541 C.E., a series of volcanic eruptions in North and Central America sent tons of ash into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight, chilling the globe, and destroying crops worldwide. Societies everywhere struggled to survive. But for the Ancestral Pueblo people living in what today is the U.S. Southwest, this climate catastrophe planted the seeds for a more cohesive, technologically sophisticated society, a new study suggests. ...Although there’s no way to perfectly reconstruct how the Ancestral Pueblo people’s social systems broke down and reformed, Sinensky thinks it may have happened something like this: As crops continued to fail, the small, disparate groups eventually had to band together to survive. They shared technology and growing techniques and built villages. Then, as rain and warmth returned, this cohesion persisted. Chaco Canyon emerged as a major cultural center for a resilient, restructured society. The findings speak to the ability of humans to reorganize in response to even extreme climate changes, Sinensky adds. “Ancestral Pueblo people restructured … and thrived with this reorganized economic and political structure,” he says. “We should take some solace in knowing that it’s possible to reorganize, to change, even deeply rooted aspects of societies.”… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-one-society-rebounded-worst-year-be-alive">https://www.science.org/content/article/how-one-society-rebounded-worst-year-be-alive</a>] For GSS Life and Climate chapter 12.</p>

By&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rlsanders@berkeley.edu?subject=RE:%20Microbes%20provide%20sustainable%20hydrocarbons%20for%20petrochemical%20industry">Robert Sanders</a>, UC Berkeley News. Excerpt: If the petrochemical industry is ever to wean itself off oil and gas, it has to find sustainably-sourced chemicals that slip effortlessly into existing processes for making products such as fuels, lubricants and plastics. Making those chemicals biologically is the obvious option, but microbial products are different from fossil fuel hydrocarbons in two key ways: They contain too much oxygen, and they have too many other atoms hanging off the carbons. ...they often have to be de-oxygenated — in chemical parlance, reduced — and stripped of extraneous chemical groups, all of which takes energy. A team of chemists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Minnesota has now engineered microbes to make hydrocarbon chains that can be deoxygenated more easily and using less energy — basically just the sugar glucose that the bacteria eat, plus a little heat. The process allows microbial production of a broad range of chemicals currently made from oil and gas — in particular, products like lubricants made from medium-chain hydrocarbons, which contain between eight and 10 carbon atoms in the chain. ...The bacteria were engineered to make hydrocarbon chains of medium length, which has not been achieved before, though others have developed microbial processes for making shorter and longer chains, up to about 20 carbons. But the process can be readily adapted to make chains of other lengths, Chang said, including short-chain hydrocarbons used as precursors to the most popular plastics, such as polyethylene.… [<a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/11/23/microbes-provide-sustainable-hydrocarbons-for-petrochemical-industry">https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/11/23/microbes-provide-sustainable-hydrocarbons-for-petrochemical-industry</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 3.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2021-11-23. <strong>Big Batteries on Wheels Can Deliver Zero-Emissions Rail While Securing the Grid</strong>. By <strong><a href="mailto:media@lbl.gov">Kiran Julin</a></strong>, Berkeley Lab News. Abstract:&nbsp; Nearly all US locomotives are propelled by diesel-electric drives, which emit 35 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and produce air pollution causing about 1,000 premature deaths annually, accounting for approximately US$6.5 billion in annual health damage costs. Improved battery technology plus access to cheap renewable electricity open the possibility of<strong>&nbsp;battery-electric rail</strong>. Here [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00915-5">paper in Nature</a>] we show that a 241-km range can be achieved using a single standard boxcar equipped with a 14-MWh battery and inverter, while consuming half the energy consumed by diesel trains. ...Accounting for reduced criteria air pollutants and CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions, switching to battery-electric propulsion would save the US freight rail sector US$94 billion over 20 years. [And from Berkeley Lab article:] ...With the rise of extreme weather events and power outages, battery-electric trains have the potential to be deployed nationwide to avoid blackouts. These modular, battery tender cars can be transported to where they are needed and charged in locations where the electricity prices are low, thus offering significant advantages over grid-scale storage. Moreover, the battery tender cars could work as modular shipping containers, capable of exchange between freight rail and maritime shipping vessels, with positive benefits to decarbonizing both sectors and expanding the resilience reach. “Conversion of the U.S. freight rail sector to battery-electric would generate about 220 gigawatt-hours of mobile storage,” said Phadke. “Furthermore, these battery tender cars could be deployed during extreme events, such as during the recent catastrophic wildfires in California or the 2021 winter storm in Texas that left millions without access to electricity. This mobile energy storage capability would also create a potential new revenue stream for freight rail operators.” ....

Excerpt: ...remote sensing methods are not only revolutionizing how scientists ...study ecosystems, they’re also poised to become powerful new tools in the fight to protect them. ...scientists have gathered to revise the most important international treaty aimed at conservation, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). With the loss of plant and animal species accelerating, some researchers say conservation efforts should turn to remote sensing to monitor biodiversity in near–real time across wide swaths of the globe—and help policymakers prioritize the most critical areas. ...As the light displaces electrons inside chlorophyll, the intensity of red and infrared (IR) light emitted from the leaves varies, depending on how healthy the plant is.&nbsp;...fluorescence could be detected from an airplane flying over crops, opening the way to surveying fields’ productivity remotely. ...airplanes, drones, and towers all provide spectroscopic data on vegetation. So does NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey’s series of Landsat satellites, the first of which were launched in the 1970s. Initially, the agencies expected the satellites’ cameras to primarily capture images in visible light, but an experimental spectral sensor on board proved the value of recording more of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as near-IR light, and by 2013 the satellites were monitoring 11 portions of the spectrum. With these “multispectral” data, researchers can monitor how “green” or productive a vegetated landscape is. Spectroscopically detected dips in chlorophyll can also signal a forest that is suffering because of drought or insect invasion—or has been cleared for development.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/satellites-offer-new-ways-study-ecosystems-maybe-even-save-them">https://www.science.org/content/article/satellites-offer-new-ways-study-ecosystems-maybe-even-save-them</a>] For GSS Digital Earth Watch chapter 6?.</p>

Vitart</a></strong>, AGU, Eos. Excerpt: Like atmospheric variability, variability in ocean conditions, such as sea surface temperature and salinity and sea ice cover and thickness, can have major effects on human activities and ecosystems both at sea and on land. For example, this variability, also called “ocean weather,” can influence the occurrence of fair-weather coastal flooding, which disrupts transportation and degrades coastal infrastructure around the world. Meanwhile, sea ice movement in an increasingly ice-free Arctic Ocean poses risks to high-latitude shipping. Elsewhere, changes in ocean upwelling can enhance coastal commercial fishing activity, whereas marine heat waves can disrupt fisheries and coral communities. As with atmospheric weather forecasts, knowing about ocean weather in advance can help minimize disruptions to everyday public and commercial activity, keep coastal and maritime workers safe, and aid marine conservation efforts. Unlike atmospheric weather, however, which evolves on daily timescales, ocean weather typically evolves on weekly to monthly timescales....

Together with the neighboring Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, which TNC helped establish in 1989, the forest will anchor an 11-million-acre network of protected land that spans an area roughly the size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined—amounting to almost a third of the entire Selva Maya. With the most recent deal, Belizeans have boosted their total protected land area to nearly 40%. Tropical forests serve as valuable carbon reserves, potentially representing up to a quarter of the climate mitigation needed globally by 2030 under the Paris Agreement.

A new report finds that carbon emissions from deforestation and other land use changes have decreased over the past decade, partly compensating for increases from burning fossil fuels. Based on updated estimates from satellite data, the report from the Global Carbon Project finds that emissions from sources such as fires, logging, and forest clearing, offset by some reforestation and regrowth of forests and abandoned farm lands,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2021-386/" target="_blank">have been decreasing by about 4% a year</a>&nbsp;over the past decade. But current emissions remain too high to appreciably curb warming.... <strong>Asia eyes switch to renewables</strong>. The Asian Development Bank last week announced a program to substantially cut carbon emissions from Southeast Asia by helping retire coal-fired power plants and replacing the generating capacity with renewable energy.... <strong>U.S. infrastructure bill bolsters climate response</strong>. The $1.2 billion infrastructure bill that President Joe Biden was expected to sign into law this week contains numerous provisions to bolster climate adaptation and accelerate efforts to curb global warming. The law provides $47 billion to prepare the country for worsening fires, floods, and storms. It funds electric car charging stations and mass transit and contains $9.5 billion to develop “clean” hydrogen fuel, produced from low-carbon sources, for industrial use. An additional $3.5 billion will fund four centers to study ways of removing carbon directly from the atmosphere.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/news-glance-carbon-emission-offsets-covid-19-vaccines-kids-and-scientists-plagiarism">https://www.science.org/content/article/news-glance-carbon-emission-offsets-covid-19-vaccines-kids-and-scientists-plagiarism</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 10.</p>

Peatlands have gotten a bum rap. They’re inhospitable, useless. Too wet to plow, too dry to fish, the old farmers say. Scorned as anaerobic wastelands, dissed in the popular imagination, imagined as the eerie Dead Marshes in “The Lord of the Rings” or the forbidding Grimpen Mire in “The Hound of the Baskervilles.”  ...All slander, said Christian Dunn, wetlands scientist at Bangor University in Wales. “Peat is the superhero of the natural world,” he said.

Excerpt:  Thousands of youth activists at the Glasgow climate talks this week demonstrated for action from world leaders whose words convey the seriousness of the emergency but whose actions against major carbon contributors are lacking. But, as host Jane Coaston says, “as fun as <em>doomerism</em> is, doomerism doesn’t do anything.” So what is an individual to do? Recycle? Compost? Give up meat or flying or plastic straws? Protest in the streets? To parse which personal actions matter and which don’t, Jane is joined by the climate activist and author Genevieve Guenther, who argues that for the wealthier citizens of the world, there are real steps that can be taken right away to help fight the current and impending climate catastrophes.

Excerpt: China is making its Belt and Road Initiative more environmentally friendly. The massive infrastructure program could still cause ecological devastation. ...The 40 wind turbines dotting the rolling grassland 9 kilometers south of Zhanatas, an impoverished industrial town in southern Kazakhstan, are monuments to change. ...the $160 million Zhanatas Wind Farm has a capacity of 100 megawatts (MW), making it one of the most powerful wind farms in central Asia. It’s a milestone in Kazakhstan’s quest to boost reliance on renewables and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The country has 300 years’ worth of coal, but isn’t building a single new plant to burn it. The project stands out for another reason as well: It is one of the biggest renewable energy projects built in the region under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a colossal infrastructure plan that has alarmed environmental advocates. Launched in 2013, BRI links China to markets and sources of raw materials around the world while stimulating economic growth in developing countries. It is providing much-needed power plants, roads, ports, and railways in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. But the “infrastructure tsunami” also threatens to “open a Pandora’s box of environmental crises, including large-scale deforestation, habitat fragmentation, wildlife poaching, water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions,” ecologist William Laurance of James Cook University, Cairns, wrote in&nbsp;<em>The Conversation&nbsp;</em>in 2017.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/china-s-global-infrastructure-program-goes-green-could-still-devastate-ecosystems">https://www.science.org/content/article/china-s-global-infrastructure-program-goes-green-could-still-devastate-ecosystems</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 9.</p>

A new fund, to be launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, U.K., will help retire coal plants in the region and replace them with solar and wind power installations. ...ADB is initially targeting Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. All three countries have increased reliance on coal-fired power in recent years and have additional plants in the pipeline.

European Union leaders have cast themselves as the vanguard of a global green transition at the international climate talks that kick off this weekend in Glasgow. ...Europe accounts for a very large share of global emissions produced since the start of the industrial age, and its ability to pivot away from fossil fuels is key to averting ruinous rates of global warming. At the heart of the surge in electricity prices is Europe’s reliance on natural gas to turn on the lights, heat homes, and power industry. Even though most countries in the bloc are moving away from coal faster than other parts of the world, like Asia, they have continued to lean on gas while building out their renewable energy infrastructure.… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/climate/europe-energy-crisis-cop.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/climate/europe-energy-crisis-cop.html</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 9.</p>

Excerpt: ...the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, but current national pledges only trim emissions by 7.5%, the United Nations Environment Programme warned this week. In a bid to achieve the Paris goal, some nations at the meeting, formally known as the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), are expected to commit to deeper emissions cuts, especially from the burning of fossil fuels. While nations step up their pledges, some scientists and policymakers are focused on making sure they stick to them. They are nurturing rapidly emerging technologies—including satellites, sensors, and software—that promise a quick and accurate assessment of greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane.… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/eve-climate-summit-researchers-sharpen-emissions-tracking">https://www.science.org/content/article/eve-climate-summit-researchers-sharpen-emissions-tracking</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 9.</p>

By&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://eos.org/author/david-shultz">David Shultz</a></strong>, Eos/AGU. Excerpt: ...Earth’s ocean is clearly rising. Between the loss of land and sea ice and warmer waters expanding, rising sea level is a global issue. But the equation governing exactly where the land meets the ocean also depends on the land itself. For instance, various forces such as the motion of tectonic plates can cause&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147436/taking-a-measure-of-sea-level-rise-land-motion" target="_blank">vertical land motion</a>&nbsp;(VLM) that either exacerbates or mitigates the threat of sea level rise. VLM is caused by a host of different factors. Tectonic forces can drive continents up or down as plates subduct beneath one another. But motion can also result from changes in the water content in an aquifer or stored in the land’s surface water. In a new study supported by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sealevel.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA’s Sea Level Change program</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JB022355" target="_blank"><em>Hammond et al.</em></a>&nbsp;use GPS station data from thousands of sites across the planet to create a global map of VLM along the coasts, which the authors say, can be compared to tide gauge data to forecast future sea level rise. &nbsp;One particularly important cause of VLM is&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/glacial-adjustment.html" target="_blank">glacial isostatic adjustment</a>&nbsp;(GIA), which describes how Earth’s crust rebounds after ice melts away.

Excerpt: ...Two years ago, a paleontologist claimed to have found evidence at a fossil-rich North Dakotan site called Tanis that dinosaurs were alive until moments after the impact, when floodwaters surged over them. But many paleontologists were skeptical, especially because the dinosaur data were first discussed in a magazine story rather than a peer-reviewed journal. Last week, at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America (GSA) in Portland, Oregon, paleontologist Robert DePalma and colleagues added detail to their claims.

Winter heating bills are declining, and Russian fishermen have found a modest pollock catch in thawed areas of the Arctic Ocean near Alaska. Nowhere do the prospects seem brighter than in Russia’s Far North, where rapidly rising temperatures have opened up a panoply of new possibilities, like mining and energy projects. Perhaps the most profound of these is the prospect, as early as next year, of year-round Arctic shipping with specially designed “ice class” container vessels, offering an alternative to the Suez Canal. ...The trip from Busan, in South Korea, to Amsterdam, for example, is 13 days shorter over the Northern Sea Route — a significant savings in time and fuel.… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/world/europe/russia-arctic-climate-change-putin.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/world/europe/russia-arctic-climate-change-putin.html</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 8.</p>

Excerpt: This holistic approach to land management is called regenerative agriculture. It eschews conventional farming techniques and taps into composting, pollinator habitat restoration and other measures to encourage nutrient-dense soil. These practices also curb skyrocketing carbon emissions by coaxing carbon from the atmosphere and into plant roots, a process known as carbon sequestration. Nitrogen, supplied by cover crops, helps the process. ...Indeed, mitigating climate change is the end goal. And while many wineries around the world are also implementing decarbonization measures, vineyards in Sonoma County are some of the earliest pioneers in the practice.… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/travel/sonoma-county-regenerative-agriculture.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/travel/sonoma-county-regenerative-agriculture.html</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 10.</p>

Excerpt: Hundreds of poachers are arrested each year for killing elephants, rhinos, pangolins and other animals in Africa. Yet the problem persists, because there is always a ready supply of desperate men to take the place of those put behind bars. Higher-level criminals, on the other hand — those who really drive the international illegal wildlife trade — almost always evade justice. Malawi, the southern African nation bounded by Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia, once fell prey to this lax law enforcement and became “one of the biggest wildlife trafficking hubs in Southern Africa,” said Dudu Douglas-Hamilton, head of counter wildlife trafficking at the Elephant Crisis Fund, a nonprofit group that supports conservation projects across Africa. But significant efforts on the ground to combat the country’s difficulties with poaching and trafficking have started to pay off, and the example Malawi is now setting may show other African nations how they can do the same. On Sept. 28, a judge in Lilongwe, the country’s capital, sentenced Yunhua Lin to as much as 14 years in prison for a variety of charges he was previously found guilty of: rhino horn possession and dealing, and money laundering. Investigators say Mr. Lin, a 48-year-old Chinese citizen, played a central role in turning Malawi into a wildlife crime hot spot. After he serves his concurrent sentences, he will be deported to China..… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/science/malawi-poaching-wildlife.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/science/malawi-poaching-wildlife.html</a>] For GSS Losing Biodiversity chapter 8.</p>

Excerpt: <em>A chronicle of a slow-motion climate disaster that became one of Oregon’s deadliest calamities.</em> …Typhoon Champi caused no serious damage and no loss of human life. But a number of atmospheric scientists believe that it may be what gave the jet stream a snap. After the storm diminished, its force continued on, crimping the jet stream into a sharply curved band, or what meteorologists refer to as an omega block, because it resembles the Greek letter. This led to what’s called, colloquially, a heat dome, a high-pressure system in which hot air is trapped over a single geographic area. It stalled over British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon, sealing in the heat. ...In the course of the heat wave, the cooling shelters hosted fourteen hundred people overnight. At its peak, the convention center housed three hundred and eighty-five in a single night, not to mention dozens of dogs and cats, and a few rabbits—a temperature-controlled ark riding out the wave in a city blistering under the deadly reckoning of climate change. ...By the time temperatures cooled, at least ninety-six people would be confirmed by the state medical examiner to have died of heat-related causes, making this one of the deadliest natural disasters in Oregon’s history....

Excerpt: As 20,000 government leaders, journalists, activists and celebrities from around the world prepare to descend on Glasgow for a crucial climate summit starting late this month, another high-level international environmental meeting got started this week. The problem it seeks to tackle: A rapid collapse of species and systems that collectively sustain life on earth. ...Climate change is only one driver of biodiversity loss. For now, the major culprit on land is humans destroying habitat through activities like farming, mining and logging. At sea, it’s overfishing. Other causes include pollution and introduced species that drive out native ones. “When you have two concurrent existential crises, you don’t get to pick only one to focus on — you must address both no matter how challenging,” said Brian O’Donnell, director of the Campaign for Nature, an advocacy group. “This is the equivalent of having a flat tire and a dead battery in your car at the same time.

Excerpt: When our sun enters its death throes in about five billion years, it will incinerate our planet and then dramatically collapse into a dead ember known as a white dwarf. But the fate of more distant planets, such as Jupiter or Saturn, is less clear. On Wednesday<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03869-6" target="_blank">&nbsp;in the journal Nature</a>, astronomers reported observing a tantalizing preview of our solar system’s afterlife: a Jupiter-size planet orbiting a white dwarf some 6,500 light years from here.

Excerpt: As the earth’s climate warms, residents of affluent nations will find some relief with air conditioning, but people in lower-income countries may have to pay vastly more for electricity or do without cooling, says a new study co-authored at the University of California, Berkeley. The research,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03883-8">published today in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em></a>, provides a dramatic new view of how climate change will aggravate the global gap between rich and poor nations. It found that even as temperatures rise, electricity consumption in the U.S. might increase only slightly by the end of the century. But in some emerging countries, demand for energy could rise dramatically as residents seek access to air conditioning, while others will still be so poor that air conditioning will remain an inaccessible dream, the researchers found. ...“While some form of air conditioning is present in 90% of homes in the United States,” Rode explained, “this is currently true for only 5% of homes in India. As climate change causes heat waves to become more intense and frequent in future decades, the data show that electricity to power cooling technology, like fans or air conditioners, remains out of reach for more than half of the global population.”… [<a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/10/13/air-conditioning-in-a-changing-climate-a-growing-rich-poor-divide/">https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/10/13/air-conditioning-in-a-changing-climate-a-growing-rich-poor-divide/</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 8.</p>

Because the paint absorbs less heat from the sun than it emits, a surface coated with this paint is cooled below the surrounding temperature without consuming power. Typical commercial white paint gets warmer rather than cooler. Paints on the market that are designed to reject heat reflect only 80%-90% of sunlight and can’t make surfaces cooler than their surroundings.

Source: By <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/sarah-kaplan/">Sarah Kaplan</a>, The Washington Post. Excerpt: Scientists hope this new kind of perennial grain offers a taste of what environmentally friendly farming could look like. ...Most commercial crops are annual. They provide only one harvest and must be replanted every year. Growing these foods on an industrial scale usually takes huge amounts of water, fertilizer and energy, making agriculture a major source of carbon and other pollutants. Scientists say this style of farming has imperiled Earth’s soils, destroyed vital habitats and contributed to the dangerous warming of our world. But Kernza — a domesticated form of wheatgrass developed by scientists at the nonprofit Land Institute — is perennial. A single seed will grow into a plant that provides grain year after year after year. It forms deep roots that store carbon in the soil and prevent erosion. It can be planted alongside other crops to reduce the need for fertilizer and provide habitat for wildlife. In short, proponents say, it can mimic the way a natural ecosystem works — potentially transforming farming from a cause of environmental degradation into a solution to the planet’s biggest crises.… [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2021/bread-baking-sustainable-grain-kernza/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2021/bread-baking-sustainable-grain-kernza/</a>] For GSS Population Growth chapter 5.</p>

It can’t be done by just switching to electric cars. Several cities are starting to electrify mass transit. ...a quiet transformation is underway. Berlin, Bogotá and several other cities are taking creative steps to cut gas and diesel from their public transit systems.&nbsp;...Berlin is reviving electric tram lines that were ripped out when the Berlin Wall went up. Bogotá is building cable cars that cut through the clouds to connect working-class communities perched on faraway hills. Bergen, a city by the fjords in western Norway, is moving its public ferries away from diesel and onto batteries — a remarkable shift in a petrostate that has for decades enriched itself from the sale of oil and gas and that now wants to be a leader in marine vessels for the electric age. Bergen’s buses, too, are now electric, supplied by Chinese bus makers that have seized on the market in cities as far afield as Los Angeles and Santiago, Chile. The change is audible. “You can hear voices again in the streets,” said Jon Askeland, the mayor of the county that includes Bergen.… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/climate/cities-public-transit-electric-tram-ferry-bus-cable-car.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/climate/cities-public-transit-electric-tram-ferry-bus-cable-car.html</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 9.</p>

The effort seeks to demonstrate ways of reversing more than 100 years of mismanagement that have transformed many forests into tinderboxes. It is also a study in how to overcome decades of disagreements among scientists, environmentalists, and forest workers on how to best protect both ecosystems and local economies. Here, environmentalists are welcoming chainsaws, and loggers are collaborating with scientists once reviled by the timber industry. ...the research has become increasingly relevant as a warming climate increases the risks of wildfires so intense that they sterilize soils and kill massive old trees. Helping forests become more resilient is critical, Johnston says, because “we’re going to have a hard time growing trees under hotter, drier conditions.”… [<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/huge-forest-experiment-aims-reduce-wildfires-can-it-unite-loggers-and-environmentalists">https://www.science.org/content/article/huge-forest-experiment-aims-reduce-wildfires-can-it-unite-loggers-and-environmentalists</a>] For GSS A New World View chapter 4.</p>

  <p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2021-08-30. New Report Shows Technology Advancement and Value of Wind Energy. Source: By Berkeley Lab News Release&nbsp;<strong><a href="mailto:mnerzig@lbl.gov">Media Relations</a></strong>. Excerpt: Wind energy continues to see strong growth, solid performance, and low prices in the U.S., according to a report released by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and prepared by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). With levelized costs of just over $30 per megawatt-hour (MWh) for newly built projects, the cost of wind is well below its grid-system, health, and climate benefits. “Wind energy prices ­– ­particularly in the central United States, and supported by federal tax incentives – remain low, with utilities and corporate buyers selecting wind as a low-cost option,” said Berkeley Lab Senior Scientist Ryan Wiser. “Considering the health and climate benefits of wind energy makes the economics even better.” Key findings from the DOE’s annual “Land-Based Wind Market Report” include: <strong>Wind comprises a growing share of electricity supply.&nbsp;</strong>U.S. wind power capacity grew at a record pace in 2020, with nearly $25 billion invested in 16.8 gigawatts (GW) of capacity. Wind energy output rose to account for more than 8% of the entire nation’s electricity supply, and is more than 20% in 10 states. At least 209 GW of wind are seeking access to the transmission system; 61 GW of this capacity are offshore wind and 13 GW are hybrid plants that pair wind with storage or solar. ...Wind turbine prices are averaging $775 to $850/kilowatt (kW). The average installed cost of wind projects in 2020 was $1,460/kW, down more than 40% since the peak in 2010, though stable for the last three years. The lowest costs were found in Texas.… [<a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/08/30/technology-advancement-and-value-of-wind-energy/">https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/08/30/technology-advancement-and-value-of-wind-energy/</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 10.</p>

But whether it’s Bennu or another asteroid, the question will be how to avoid a very unwelcome cosmic rendezvous. For almost 20 years, a team of researchers has been preparing for such a scenario. Using a specially designed gun, they’ve repeatedly fired projectiles at meteorites and measured how the space rocks recoiled and, in some cases, shattered.

Excerpt: Lake Mead, a reservoir formed by the construction of the Hoover Dam in the 1930s, is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure on the Colorado River, supplying fresh water to Nevada, California, Arizona and Mexico. The reservoir hasn’t been full since 1983. In 2000, it began a steady decline caused by epochal drought. ...Like the record-breaking heat waves and the ceaseless mega-fires, the decline of the Colorado River has been faster than expected. This year, even though rainfall and snowpack high up in the Rocky Mountains were at near-normal levels, the parched soils and plants stricken by intense heat absorbed much of the water, and inflows to Lake Powell were around one-fourth of their usual amount. The Colorado’s flow has already declined by nearly 20 percent, on average, from its flow throughout the 1900s, and if the current rate of warming continues, the loss could well be 50 percent by the end of this century. Earlier this month, federal officials declared an emergency water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time. The shortage declaration forces reductions in water deliveries to specific states, beginning with the abrupt cutoff of nearly one-fifth of Arizona’s supply from the river, and modest cuts for Nevada and Mexico, with more negotiations and cuts to follow. But it also sounded an alarm: one of the country’s most important sources of fresh water is in peril, another victim of the accelerating climate crisis.… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/sunday-review/colorado-river-drying-up.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/sunday-review/colorado-river-drying-up.html</a>] For GSS Climate Change chapter 8.</p>

Excerpt: Scientists have known about urban heat islands since the 1880s, when they noted temperatures in London were higher than in surrounding areas. Cities are typically warmer than their suburban and rural counterparts because they lack green spaces, which mitigate the heat radiated by human-built structures made from asphalt, concrete, and brick. New York is one of 12 cities participating in this year’s mapping campaign, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has run for the past four summers in dozens of cities. The teams record morning, afternoon, and evening temperatures on one of the hottest days of the year. The goal is to identify areas with the greatest need for measures—like installing green roofs, operating cooling centers, and planting trees or other vegetation—that are designed to mitigate the effects of the extreme heat.… [<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/scientists-map-urban-heat-islands-and-track-how-communities-are-affected">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/scientists-map-urban-heat-islands-and-track-how-communities-are-affected</a>] - For GSS Climate Change chapter 8.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>2021-08-19. Massive volcanoes could cool Earth more in a warming world. By&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/paul-voosen">Paul Voosen</a>, Science Magazine. Excerpt: ...Before humanity started in on its planet-altering course, volcanoes were one of the biggest climate players. Over the long term, they belched carbon dioxide from Earth’s interior, causing warming. But in the short term, their sulfur gases often react with water to form highly reflective particles called sulfates, triggering spells of global cooling. Dark smudges of ash littering ice cores—our best evidence of these early eruptions—are a dim reflection of the wild weather left in their wake. But the opposite is also true, it turns out: Climate can have a big impact on volcanoes.

<p>&lt;>&lt;>&lt;>&lt;>&lt;><br>2021-08-19. Massive volcanoes could cool Earth more in a warming world. By <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/paul-voosen">Paul Voosen</a>, Science Magazine. Excerpt: ...Before humanity started in on its planet-altering course, volcanoes were one of the biggest climate players. Over the long term, they belched carbon dioxide from Earth’s interior, causing warming. But in the short term, their sulfur gases often react with water to form highly reflective particles called sulfates, triggering spells of global cooling. Dark smudges of ash littering ice cores—our best evidence of these early eruptions—are a dim reflection of the wild weather left in their wake. But the opposite is also true, it turns out: Climate can have a big impact on volcanoes. In the new study, Thomas Aubry, a geophysicist at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues combined computer simulations of idealized volcanic eruptions with a global climate model. They simulated the response to plumes released from midsize and large volcanoes both in historical conditions and by 2100, in a scenario when Earth is predicted to warm very rapidly. ...ultramassive eruptions would still be able to punch through to the stratosphere; what’s more, their gases would actually reach higher and travel faster than in the present climate, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24943-7">amplifying their cooling effect by 15%</a>, the researchers report this month in <em>Nature Communications</em>.

<p>&lt;>&lt;>&lt;>&lt;>&lt;><br>2021-08-17. Scientists map urban heat islands—and track how communities are affected. By <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/anil-oza">Anil Oza</a>, Science  Magazine. Excerpt: Scientists have known about urban heat islands since the 1880s, when they noted temperatures in London were higher than in surrounding areas. Cities are typically warmer than their suburban and rural counterparts because they lack green spaces, which mitigate the heat radiated by human-built structures made from asphalt, concrete, and brick. New York is one of 12 cities participating in this year’s mapping campaign, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has run for the past four summers in dozens of cities. The teams record morning, afternoon, and evening temperatures on one of the hottest days of the year. The goal is to identify areas with the greatest need for measures—like installing green roofs, operating cooling centers, and planting trees or other vegetation—that are designed to mitigate the effects of the extreme heat.… [<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/scientists-map-urban-heat-islands-and-track-how-communities-are-affected">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/scientists-map-urban-heat-islands-and-track-how-communities-are-affected</a>] - For GSS Climate Change chapter 8.</p>

Source: By <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">Kenneth Chang</a>, The New York Times. Excerpt: Scientists have come tantalizingly close to reproducing the power of the sun — albeit only in a speck of hydrogen for a fraction of a second. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory reported on Tuesday that by using 192 gigantic lasers to annihilate a pellet of hydrogen, they were able to ignite a burst of more than 10 quadrillion watts of fusion power — energy released when hydrogen atoms are fused into helium, the same process that occurs within stars. ...And all of the fusion energy emanated from a hot spot about as wide as a human hair, he said. ...But the burst — essentially a miniature hydrogen bomb — lasted only 100 trillionths of a second. Still, that spurred a burst of optimism for fusion scientists who have long hoped that fusion could someday provide a boundless, clean energy source for humanity.… [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/science/lasers-fusion-power-watts-earth.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/science/lasers-fusion-power-watts-earth.html</a>] For GSS Energy Use chapter 10.</p>

<p>2021-08-06. Don’t Call It a Supervolcano. Source: By <a href="https://eos.org/author/m-c-morton">Mary Caperton Morton</a>, Eos/AGU  Excerpt: Yellowstone National Park, the world’s first and arguably most famous national park, is home to one of the planet’s largest and potentially most destructive volcanoes. The 50- by 70-kilometer Yellowstone caldera complex is so massive that it can really be appreciated only from the air. But although the caldera isn’t always visible on the ground, it’s certainly no secret: Copious thermal features like hot springs and geyser basins dot the landscape and have attracted people to the uniquely beautiful and ecologically rich area for at least 11,000 years. ...Every season, recurring bouts of <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/what-causes-earthquake-swarms-yellowstone?qt-news_science_products=4">earthquake swarms</a> trigger sensational stories that Yellowstone could be gearing up for another “big one.” But there’s no need to cancel your family vacation to see the park’s free-roaming bison and grizzly bears: The geologists who keep a very close eye on the Yellowstone caldera system say it’s not going to erupt again in our lifetimes. ...The story of Yellowstone begins around 16.5 million years ago, when a plume of magma began fueling intense bouts of volcanism along the border of what is now Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon. This magma plume, like the one that formed the Hawaiian Islands, is stationary, but as the North American plate moves to the southwest over the hot spot, its surface expression migrates, creating a 750-kilometer-long trail of volcanism, including dozens of calderas, across southern Idaho and into northwest Wyoming....

Excerpt: Small streams that dry up for part of the year are easy to overlook. But these intermittent streams are everywhere, making up more than half of Earth’s waterways. They help purify surface water and provide crucial habitat for creatures such as the Sonoran Desert toad, fairy shrimp, and Wilson’s warbler. Now, a study has found that ephemeral streams across the continental United States have become less reliable over the past 40 years, likely as a result of climate change. Some are dry for 100 days longer per year than in the 1980s....

Excerpt: When stars run out of fuel, they can collapse under their own gravity, exploding as supernovae that blast debris and radioactive nuclei far into space. Most of these events are too far from Earth to affect our planet. But if one happened nearby, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/exploding-stars-may-have-assaulted-ancient-earth">the effects could be dramatic</a>. By studying radioactive isotopes on Earth, scientists have uncovered evidence suggesting two near-Earth supernovae occurred in the past few million years. Some researchers now hypothesize that supernova-generated particles known as cosmic rays might have depleted the ozone layer, increased cancer rates in ancient organisms, sparked wildfires, and even started an ice age....

Excerpt: The report paints an alarming picture but emphasizes there is still time for swift action to mitigate the worst of the projected impacts of climate change. ...Too much focus on targets like 1.5°C can backfire if they are seen as precipices beyond which there is no redemption, Tebaldi says: “People feel this sense of disempowerment.” The reality, she says, is that these targets sit on a continuum where “every little bit of warming counts.” For the first time, the report elaborates on the details of how each increment of warming is expected to play out in regional impacts and extreme events such as flooding, heat waves, droughts, and fire....
