                   Coffee Grounds Offer New Source Of Biodiesel
                   Fuel.</a> Science Daily. <span>Excerpt:
                   Researchers in Nevada are reporting that waste
                   coffee grounds can provide a cheap, abundant,
                   and environmentally friendly source of biodiesel
                   fuel for powering cars and trucks.<br />
In the new study, Mano Misra, Susanta Mohapatra, and Narasimharao
Kondamudi note that the major barrier to wider use of biodiesel
fuel is lack of a low-cost, high quality source, or feedstock,
for producing that new energy source. Spent coffee grounds contain
between 11 and 20 percent oil by weight. That's about as much
as traditional biodiesel feedstocks such as rapeseed, palm, and
soybean oil.<br />
...The scientists estimated...that spent coffee grounds can potentially
add 340 million gallons of biodiesel to the world's fuel supply.<br />
To verify it, the scientists collected spent coffee grounds from
a multinational coffeehouse chain and separated the oil. They
then used an inexpensive process to convert 100 percent of the
oil into biodiesel.<br />
...The scientists estimate that the process could make a profit
of more than $8 million a year in the U.S. alone. They plan to
develop a small pilot plant to produce and test the experimental
fuel within the next six to eight months....</span></p>

                   Young on gas guzzlers: Long may you run.</a> By
                   Al Saracevic, San Francisco Chronicle. <span>Excerpt:
                   Leave it to Neil Young to make green technology
                   cool.<br />
                   The rock legend has created a company called
                   Linc Volt Technology to promote the conversion
                   of existing gas-guzzling cars into vehicles
                   that run on alternative energy.<br />
                   ...Young, who likes his cars old and big,
                   is launching his effort by converting a 1959
                   Lincoln Continental to run on electricity
                   and natural gas.... All 5,000 pounds of it.<br />
                   ..."All we're doing is showing that you
                   can run a car like this at 100 miles per gallon
                   or more," said Young, standing next to
                   the cream-colored beauty at a South San Francisco
                   auto shop. "Our main focus is on developing
                   the technology. We can tell people how to
                   do it. Or, we can do it for you."<br />
                   ...The car's conversion to a green machine
                   started about a year ago when Young was feeling
                   guilty about driving his oil-burning behemoth....<br />
                   He approached a Wichita, Kan., entrepreneur
                   named Johnathan Goodwin and his company, H-Line
                   Conversions, to do the job. But once he got
                   to talking with Goodwin, he became convinced
                   that there might be an even better solution.<br />
                   H-Line had pioneered a new type of alternative-energy
                   engine that makes a car run on a variety of
                   fuel platforms. Here's how it works in a nutshell:
                   For short runs, a car can be plugged in, charged
                   and then run strictly on electricity using
                   a rotary engine and its batteries. For longer
                   hauls, there's also a generator in the car
                   that runs on compressed natural gas. When
                   electricity runs short, the generator kicks
                   in and refuels the batteries. To make matters
                   even more interesting, the car's generator
                   will actually feed electricity back into your
                   home when it's parked and plugged in in the
                   garage.<br />
  "It's a power generator," Young said. "This
  thing can power up about a third of a city block. It'll make
  your meter run backward."...</span></p>

                   Little Fuel, Eco-Racers Arrive in Las Vegas.</a> By
                   Steve Friess, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   Las Vegas — In a city accustomed to
                   the catering to the strange and offbeat, the
                   arrival Monday evening of Jack McCornack and
                   Sharon Westcott in a topless, two-foot-tall
                   green and yellow roadster at the front door
                   of the storied Sahara Hotel-Casino still turned
                   heads.<br />
                   Gawkers couldn’t have known that Mr.
                   McCornack and Ms. Westcott had just driven
                   the vehicle more than 800 miles over three
                   days from Berkeley, Calif., but many nonetheless
                   noticed the plastic tank of vegetable oil — a.k.a.
                   fuel — affixed to the back.<br />
                   In making it to Las Vegas in a total of 1,418
                   minutes without burning an ounce of petroleum,
                   the duo from Cave Junction, Ore., collected
                   a $5,000 prize in the Escape From Berkeley
                   race.<br />
                   ...Beyond the requirement to use no petroleum
                   products for fuel was the added twist that
                   the participants would have to scavenge along
                   the way for raw materials....<br />
  “I’m actually kind of shocked that anybody made
  it at all,” said Jim Mason, the event’s organizer
  and founder of a 20,000-square-foot open-air garage in Berkeley
  called Shipyard Labs where self-described “geeks and
  gearheads” work in shipping containers....<br />
                   ...Mr. McCornack’s sole rival by Monday
                   was a green Dodge Dakota that runs on oxygen,
                   hydrogen and methane power converted from
                   burned wood in a large black contraption.
                   The vehicle was driven by Wayne Keith, a 59-year-old
                   cattle rancher from Springville, Ala....<br />
                   ... Among the vehicles that didn’t make
                   it were a Mercedes-Benz that runs on vegetable
                   oil, a two-man bicycle augmented by a one-horsepower
                   electric motor that runs on ethanol, and a
                   15 m.p.h. steam-powered three-wheeler (two
                   of which are wooden)....</span></p>

                   New Car Conundrum.</a> By Christine Sarkis,
                   Terrain Magazine - The Ecology Center. <span>Excerpt:
                   I've never embraced the consume-more-to-consume-less
                   strategy; avoiding waste of any kind seems
                   essential to environmental responsibility.
                   It's one of the reasons I still drive a conventional
                   gasoline car...<br />
                   ...When it comes to your carbon footprint,
                   is it better to keep driving the car you already
                   have or buy a new hybrid? <br />
                   ...How would the Prius, that iconic hybrid,
                   stack up against my own not-very-new four-door
                   hatchback?<br />
                   ...Since I am considering replacing my existing
                   car with one that must be newly produced,
                   I need to know how long it would take to make
                   up for the emissions involved in manufacturing
                   the Prius—the equivalent of about eighteen
                   tanks of gas. Since I drive 10,000 miles each
                   year, it would take about eleven months for
                   the emissions to balance out....And since
                   I'd be using less gas, I'd be saving over
                   $900 a year at the pump. The clear message:
                   When it comes to emissions, mileage matters
                   more than manufacturing.<br />
                   How much would driving a Prius reduce my overall
                   carbon footprint? ...In my case, there would
                   be a 5,809 pound difference each year, which,
                   even including the manufacturing emissions,
                   translates to an impressive 11.8 fewer tons
                   of carbon dioxide over five years. That's
                   like erasing my carbon footprint for an entire
                   year....<br />
                   ...After crunching my way through the whole
                   equation, it seems that in my case the impulse
                   to conserve by making the most of what I've
                   got doesn't take into account vast differences
                   in fuel efficiency. In California, where people
                   drive more than 825 million miles each day,
                   getting the most out of every gallon of gasoline
                   has a tremendous environmental impact. That's
                   reason enough for me to take another look
                   at consuming a little more in order to use
                   a lot less.</span>...</p>

                   in Natural Gas Has Utah Driving Cheaply.</a> By
                   CLIFFORD KRAUSS, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   SALT LAKE CITY — The best deal on fuel
                   in the country right now might be here in
                   Utah, where people are waiting in lines to
                   pay the equivalent of 87 cents a gallon. Demand
                   is so strong at rush hour that fuel runs low,
                   and some days people can pump only half a
                   tank.<br />
                   It is not gasoline they are buying for their
                   cars, but natural gas.<br />
                   By an odd confluence of public policy and
                   private initiative, Utah has become the first
                   state in the country to experience broad consumer
                   interest in the idea of running cars on clean
                   natural gas.<br />
                   Residents of the state are hunting the Internet
                   and traveling the country to pick up used
                   natural gas cars at auctions. They are spending
                   thousands of dollars to transform their trucks
                   and sport utility vehicles to run on compressed
                   gas....<br />
                   ...Natural gas is especially cheap here, so
                   that people spend about 87 cents for a quantity
                   of gas sufficient to propel a car approximately
                   the same distance as a $3.95 gallon of gasoline.<br />
                   ...some unique factors apply in Utah. Natural
                   gas prices at the pump here are controlled
                   and are the cheapest in the country, while
                   the price of conventional gasoline is one
                   of the highest. Questar Gas, the public utility,
                   has compressed-gas pumps around the state
                   open to the public, a fueling infrastructure
                   that few states can match.<br />
                   ...Natural gas cars produce at least 20 percent
                   less greenhouse gas per mile than regular
                   cars, according to a California study.</span>...</p>

                   ...Cincinnati officials are assembling financing
                   for a $132 million [streetcar] system that
                   would connect the city’s riverfront
                   stadiums, downtown business district and Uptown
                   neighborhoods, which include six hospitals
                   and the University of Cincinnati, in a six-
                   to eight-mile loop. Depending on the final
                   financing package, fares may be free, 50 cents
                   or $1.<br />
                   ...At least 40 other cities are exploring
                   streetcar plans to spur economic development,
                   ease traffic congestion and draw young professionals
                   and empty-nest baby boomers back from the
                   suburbs, according to the Community Streetcar
                   Coalition, which includes city officials,
                   transit authorities and engineers who advocate
                   streetcar construction.<br />
                   ...Modern streetcars, like those Cincinnati
                   plans to use, cost about $3 million each,
                   run on an overhead electrical wire and carry
                   up to 130 passengers per car on rails that
                   are flush with the pavement. And since streetcars
                   can pick up passengers on either side, they
                   can make shorter stops than buses.<br />
                   Streetcar advocates point to Portland, Ore.,
                   which built the first major modern streetcar
                   system in the United States, in 2001, and
                   has since added new lines interlaced with
                   a growing light rail system. Since Portland
                   announced plans for the system, more than
                   10,000 residential units have been built and
                   $3.5 billion has been invested in property
                   within two blocks of the line, according to
                   Portland Streetcar Inc., which operates the

                   rolls out new zero-emission car.</a> By Tomoko
                   A. Hosaka, Associated Press. <span>Excerpt:
                   TAKANEZAWA, Japan (AP) -- Honda's new zero-emission,
                   hydrogen fuel cell car rolled off a Japanese
                   production line Monday and is headed to Southern
                   California, where Hollywood is already abuzz
                   over the latest splash in green motoring.<br />
                   The FCX Clarity, which runs on hydrogen and
                   electricity, emits only water and none of
                   the noxious fumes believed to induce global
                   warming. It is also two times more energy
                   efficient than a gas-electric hybrid and three
                   times that of a standard gasoline-powered
                   car, the company says.<br />
                   Japan's third biggest automaker expects to
                   lease out a "few dozen" units this
                   year and about 200 units within three years.
                   In California, a three-year lease will run
                   $600 a month, which includes maintenance and
                   collision coverage.<br />
                   The FCX Clarity is an improvement of its previous-generation
                   fuel cell vehicle, the FCX, introduced in
                   2005...<br />
                   A breakthrough in the design of the fuel cell
                   stack, which is the unit that powers the car's
                   motor, allowed engineers to lighten the body,
                   expand the interior and increase efficiency,
                   Honda said.<br />
                   The fuel cell draws on energy synthesized
                   through a chemical reaction between hydrogen
                   gas and oxygen in the air, and a lithium-ion
                   battery pack provides supplemental power.
                   The FCX Clarity has a range of about 270-miles
                   per tank with hydrogen consumption equivalent
                   to 74 miles per gallon, according to the carmaker.<br />
                   The 3,600-pound vehicle can reach speeds up
                   to 100 miles per hour.<br />
                   The biggest obstacles standing in the way
                   of wider adoption of fuel cell vehicles are
                   cost and the dearth of hydrogen fuel stations.</span>..</p>

                   Trend in Biofuels Has New Risks</a>. By ELISABETH
                   ROSENTHAL, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   ROME - In the past year, as the diversion
                   of food crops like corn and palm to make biofuels
                   has helped to drive up food prices, investors
                   and politicians have begun promoting newer,
                   so-called second-generation biofuels as the
                   next wave of green energy. These, made from
                   non-food crops like reeds and wild grasses,
                   would offer fuel without the risk of taking
                   food off the table, they said.<br />
                   But now, biologists and botanists are warning
                   that they, too, may bring serious unintended
                   consequences. Most of these newer crops are
                   what scientists label invasive species - that
                   is, weeds - that have an extraordinarily high
                   potential to escape biofuel plantations, overrun
                   adjacent farms and natural land, and create
                   economic and ecological havoc in the process,

                   gasoline yet created from sustainable biomass
                   sources like switchgrass and poplar trees.

                   ...While it may be five to 10 years before
                   green gasoline arrives at the pump or finds
                   its way into a fighter jet, these breakthroughs
                   have bypassed significant hurdles to bringing
                   green gasoline biofuels to market.<br />
  "It is likely that the future consumer will not even know
  that they are putting biofuels into their car," said Huber. "Biofuels
  in the future will most likely be similar in chemical composition
  to gasoline and diesel fuel used today. The challenge for chemical
  engineers is to efficiently produce liquid fuels from biomass
  while fitting into the existing infrastructure today."<br />
                   ..."Green gasoline is an attractive alternative
                   to bioethanol since it can be used in existing
                   engines and does not incur the 30 percent
                   gas mileage penalty of ethanol-based flex
                   fuel," said John Regalbuto, who directs
                   the Catalysis and Biocatalysis Program at
                   NSF and supported this research.<br />
  "In theory it requires much less energy to make than ethanol,
  giving it a smaller carbon footprint and making it cheaper
  to produce," Regalbuto said. "Making it from cellulose
  sources such as switchgrass or poplar trees grown as energy
  crops, or forest or agricultural residues such as wood chips
  or corn stover, solves the lifecycle greenhouse gas problem
  that has recently surfaced with corn ethanol and soy biodiesel."....</span></p>

                   WITH a history of using alternative-fuel vehicles
                   long before it became chic, White Plains now
                   is the Northeast hub - and one of three cities
                   nationwide - for a model program designed
                   to put hydrogen-powered cars in consumers'
                   hands.<br />
                   In partnership with General Motors and a division
                   of Shell Oil, the city has opened on its property
                   the only hydrogen refueling station in the
                   metropolitan area equipped for public use,
                   G.M. and city officials said.<br />
                   Proponents laud hydrogen-powered, or fuel-cell,
                   vehicles for producing virtually no emissions
                   and reducing the need for traditional fossil
                   fuel. The vehicles are still in development
                   - and out of most consumers' reach with price
                   tags for some ringing in at nearly $90,000
                   - but they are already refueling at the station
                   on the Public Works Department's refueling
                   site.<br />
                   ..."The big benefit of using hydrogen
                   as a fuel is that there is practically zero
                   pollution," said Mr. Nicoletti, who oversees
                   the city's approximately 400 vehicles, about
                   20 percent of which run on alternative energies
                   including electricity, ethanol and compressed

                   One way to reduce the world's dependence on
                   oil is to produce more cars that get their
                   power from the electrical grid rather than
                   the gas pump. In the United States, replacing
                   a large percentage of the roughly 235 million
                   cars, light trucks and sport utility vehicles
                   with all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids
                   (which have a supplemental gasoline engine)
                   would make a big dent in gasoline consumption,
                   currently about 380 million gallons a day.<br />
                   But such a shift would have an impact on another
                   of the world's precious liquids - water. It
                   takes a lot of water to produce electricity,
                   both to mine and to process coal and other
                   fuels and to cool power plants. ...in an analysis
                   in the journal Environmental Science and Technology,
                   Carey W. King and Michael E. Webber of the
                   University of Texas found ...For every mile
                   driven by a gas-powered vehicle that is displaced
                   by one driven by an electric vehicle, ...
                   about three times as much water is consumed
                   (that is, lost to evaporation) and about 17
                   times as much is withdrawn (used and returned
                   to its source).<br />
                   The researchers say the impact on water use
                   does not mean a shift to electric vehicles
                   is a bad idea. But ...particularly in areas

                   Is Called a Byproduct of a ‘Clean’ Fuel.</a> By
                   Brenda Goodman, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   Alabama’s first biodiesel plant, a refinery
                   that intended to turn soybean oil into earth-friendly
                   fuel, has been polluting the local river… The
                   spills, at the Alabama Biodiesel Corporation
                   plant outside this city about 17 miles from
                   Tuscaloosa, are similar to others that have
                   come from biofuel plants in the Midwest. The
                   discharges, which can be hazardous to birds
                   and fish, have many people scratching their
                   heads over the seeming incongruity of pollution
                   from an industry that sells products with
                   the promise of blue skies and clear streams… According
                   to the National Biodiesel Board, a trade group,
                   biodiesel is nontoxic, biodegradable and suitable
                   for sensitive environments, but scientists
                   say that position understates its potential
                   environmental impact</span><span>… In
                   January, a grand jury indicted a Missouri
                   businessman in the discharge, which killed
                   at least 25,000 fish and wiped out the population
                   of fat pocketbook mussels, an endangered species.  Back
                   in Alabama, Nelson Brooke of Black Warrior
                   Riverkeeper,
                   a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting
                   and restoring the Black Warrior River and
                   its tributaries, received a report in September
                   2006 of a fish kill that stretched 20 miles
                   downstream from Moundville...  The agency
                   did not charge Alabama Biodiesel.  In
                   August, Black Warrior Riverkeeper, in a complaint
                   filed in Federal District Court, documented
                   at least 24 occasions when oil was spotted
                   in the water near the plant…  In
                   October 2005, the Alabama Department of Environmental
                   Management informed Alabama Biodiesel that
                   it would need an individual pollution discharge
                   permit to operate, but the company never applied
                   for one. The company operated for more than
                   a year without a permit and without facing
                   any penalties from state regulators, though
                   inspectors documented unpermitted discharges
                   on two occasions.  For some, the troubles
                   of the industry seem to outweigh its benefits. </span></p>

                   Claiming it now has the largest green fleet
                   in the nation, the city of San Francisco this
                   week completed a yearlong project to convert
                   its entire array of diesel vehicles - from
                   ambulances to street sweepers - to biodiesel,
                   a clean-burning and renewable fuel that holds
                   promise for helping to reduce greenhouse gases.<br />
                   Using virgin soy oil bought from producers
                   in the Midwest, officials said that as of
                   Friday, all of the city's 1,500 diesel vehicles
                   were powered with the environmentally friendlier
                   fuel, intended to sharply reduce toxic diesel
                   exhaust linked to a higher risk of asthma
                   and premature death.<br />
  "Just like secondhand smoke, diesel is one of the worst
  things we can breathe," said the city's clean vehicle
  manager, Vandana Bali of the Department of the Environment.<br />
                   ...Ms. Bali said the city's diesel vehicles
                   now all used a fuel known as B20, a mix of
                   20 percent soy-based biofuel and 80 percent
                   petroleum diesel fuel, which reduces toxic
                   emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons
                   and other pollutants that lead to global warming.<br />
                   ...In November, Mr. Newsom announced a new
                   project called SFGreasecycle, a program to
                   collect fats and cooking oils from restaurants,
                   at no charge.<br />
  "We are collecting grease," Mr. Ballard said. "Waste
  fats and oils are a major source of backup in our sewage system.
  But we're taking the grease that would have gone down the drain
  and turning it into biodiesel."</span></p>

                   But a rapid global expansion of bioenergy
                   development could have profound negative environmental
                   and economic consequences. If bioenergy is

                   By WILLIAM YARDLEY, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   PORTLAND, Ore. - ...Cyclists have long revered
                   Portland for its bicycle-friendly culture
                   and infrastructure, including the network
                   of bike lanes that the city began planning
                   in the early 1970s. Now, riders are helping
                   the city build a cycling economy.<br />
                   ...what is most distinctive about the emerging
                   cycling industry here is the growing number
                   of smaller businesses, whether bike frame
                   builders or clothing makers, that often extol
                   recycling as much as cycling, sustainability
                   as much as success.<br />
                   ...Mia Birk, a former city employee who helped
                   lead Portland's efforts to expand cycling
                   in the 1990s, said the original goals were
                   rooted in environmental and public health,
                   not the economy.<br />
  "That wasn't our driving force," Ms. Birk said. "But
  it has been a result, and we're comfortable saying it is a
  positive result."<br />
                   Ms. Birk now helps run a consulting firm,
                   Alta Planning and Design, which advises other
                   cities on how to become more bicycle-friendly.
                   In a report for the City of Portland last
                   year, the firm estimated that 600 to 800 people
                   worked in the cycling industry in some form.
                   A decade earlier, Ms. Birk said in an interview,
                   the number would have been more like 200 and
                   made up almost entirely of employees at retail
                   bike stores.<br />
                   ...the city is nurturing the cycling industry,
                   and there are about 125 bike-related businesses
                   in Portland, ....<br />
                   ...Sam Adams, a city commissioner in charge
                   of transportation, joined development officials
                   to help lure the show to Portland. It seemed
                   a natural fit. The city regularly ranks at
                   the top of Bicycling Magazine's list of the
                   best cycling cities and has the nation's highest
                   percentage of workers who commute by bike,
                   about 3.5 percent.... Drivers here are largely
                   respectful of riders, and some businesses
                   give up parking spaces to make way for bike
                   racks.<br />
  "Our intentions are to be as sustainable a city as possible," Mr.
  Adams said. "That means socially, that means environmentally
  and that means economically. The bike is great on all three
  of those factors. You just can't get a better transportation
  return on your investment than you get with promoting bicycling."....</span></p>

                   automobile industry around battery-powered
                   all-electric cars.<br />
                   Others are developing green cars, like the
                   Tesla and Chevrolet Volt. However, Mr. Agassi
                   is not planning to make cars, but instead
                   wants to deploy an infrastructure of battery-charging
                   stations in the United States, Europe and
                   the developing world.<br />
                   The new system will sell electric fuel on

                   place to commercialize its planned Chevrolet
                   Volt, but those batteries are still being
                   developed.<br />
                   There are also issues of safety with existing
                   lithium-ion batteries that have become unstable
                   under extreme temperatures.<br />
  "If you listen to the car companies, they suggest there
  is a fix, but it's not there yet," said Stephen J. Girsky,
  a partner at the investment firm Centerbridge Partners who

                   Boom Stalling as Glut Depresses Price</a>.
                   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS.<span> Excerpt:
                   NEVADA, Iowa, Sept. 24 - The ethanol boom
                   of recent years - which spurred a frenzy of
                   distillery construction, record corn prices,
                   rising food prices and hopes of a new future
                   for rural America - may be fading.Only last
                   year, farmers here spoke of a biofuel gold
                   rush, and they rejoiced as prices for ethanol
                   and the corn used to produce it set records.…The
                   average national ethanol price on the spot
                   market has plunged 30 percent since May, with
                   the decline escalating sharply in the last
                   few weeks…..<br />
                   ..While generous government support is expected
                   to keep the output of ethanol fuel growing,
                   the poorly planned overexpansion of the industry
                   raises questions about its ability to fulfill
                   the hopes of President Bush and other policy
                   makers to serve as a serious antidote to the
                   nation's heavy reliance on foreign oil……Many
                   industry experts say the worst problems are
                   temporary and have been intensified by transportation
                   bottlenecks in getting ethanol from the heartland
                   to the coasts, where it is needed most....The
                   falling price of ethanol comes in sharp contrast
                   to the rise in crude oil prices. Lower ethanol
                   prices help reduce gasoline prices at the
                   pump, where ethanol is available, but because
                   it constitutes 10 percent or less in most
                   blends, the impact for the consumer is marginal.<br />
                   Congress essentially legislated the industry's
                   expansion by requiring steadily higher quantities
                   of ethanol as a gasoline blend, a kick-start
                   that was further spurred by the proliferation
                   of bans on a competing fuel additive used
                   to help curb air pollution.<br />
                   But the ethanol industry, which is also heavily
                   subsidized by federal tax incentives, got
                   far ahead of the requirements of the law,
                   rapidly building scores of plants and snapping
                   up a rising share of the corn harvest....Already,
                   ethanol producers are poised to outpace that
                   mandate, with capacity expected to reach 7.8
                   billion gallons by the end of 2007 and 11.5
                   billion gallons by 2009, although some in
                   the industry are now predicting that the expansion

                   With global warming breathing down our necks,
                   energy is hot. And at Berkeley, green ideals
                   are teaming up with that other green-money.<br />
                   ...Having just announced a $500 million ten-year
                   deal with oil giant BP to found a new Energy
                   Biosciences Institute on campus, Steven Chu,
                   the Nobel Prize winner and head of Lawrence
                   Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), made
                   a pitch for more: "We are seeking industry
                   partnerships É We seek solutions. We
                   don't seek, dare I say, science papers anymore."<br />
                   Across campus, green ideals are teaming up
                   with the other green-money. Typical of the
                   new "double-greens" is the group
                   that organized the March symposium, a multidisciplinary
                   club of grad students called the Berkeley
                   Energy and Resources Collaborative, or BERC....<br />
                   Unlike previous generations of environmentalists,
                   who saw capitalism as "part of the problem," the
                   new greens see it as part of the solution,
                   if not the solution.<br />
                   ...BERC co-chair Merrian Fuller, a first-year
                   MBA candidate at Haas ..."We have to
                   experiment much more and be willing to fail," she
                   said. "We have to realize some policies
                   and initiatives might not work out."<br />
                   ...Convinced that early regulation could avoid
                   environmental disaster and benefit the state's
                   economy, the governor and the California Legislature
                   passed AB 32, the greenhouse gas legislation....
                   These regulations, which could eventually
                   allow expensive new technologies to compete
                   with cheap, entrenched fuels such as oil,
                   natural gas, and coal, made the very idea
                   of a green tech "moon shot" feasible.<br />
                   LBNL director Steven Chu ... searched for
                   technologies that were in their infancy, where
                   improvements might make a big difference.<br />
                   ...By process of elimination, Chu arrived
                   at two promising avenues for research: energy
                   efficiency-a field pioneered by Berkeley physicist
                   Art Rosenfeld-and harnessing the power of
                   the sun. Sunlight can be captured by both
                   technology and plants, which led him to identify
                   the fields of photovoltaics, nanotechnology,
                   electrochemistry, artificial photosynthesis,
                   catalysis (producing hydrogen from water using
                   sunlight), batteries (to hold energy produced
                   by solar cells), and biofuels. Chu imagined
                   a spectrum of biofuels, ranging from ethanol-which
                   requires modest leaps in innovation-to more
                   technically challenging fuels, such as butane
                   and octane, that could be used by both airplane
                   and conventional auto engines. Chu dubbed
                   these sun-related projects Helios.<br />

                   There's a lot of talk about "alternative
                   fuels" to gasoline and diesel these days,
                   especially as national security concerns make
                   reducing our dependence on foreign oil a priority.
                   As the world wakes up to the climate crisis,
                   it's become apparent that we need to do something
                   drastic about our transportation -- which
                   produces 28 percent of our emissions in the
                   US -- to stem the greenhouse gas tide.<br />
                   The truth is, not all of the "new" fuels
                   are created equal. In fact, some are nearly
                   as bad as gasoline in their environmental
                   impacts, and others can't be scaled up in

                   pennies in electrical power. The plug-in hybrid
                   automobile crowd ...gathered at San Francisco's
                   Presidio to see the latest wrinkle in emission-free
                   transportation - an electric motor scooter
                   called the Vectrix that can whiz along at
                   60 miles an hour. At $11,000, the Vectrix
                   may be a bit pricey, ...Marc Geller, a San
                   Francisco photographer who owns a rare all-electric
                   Toyota RAV4... said of the Vectrix: "I've
                   ridden it and it's fantastic. It's all about
                   the (electric) plug and environmental concerns,
                   petroleum concerns. I think it's totally cool,
                   compared to that noisy piece of [#$%&amp;*]." He
                   was referring to a loud gas-powered vehicle
                   that sped past as a few Vectrixes quietly
                   tooled around the Presidio's main parade ground
                   ...The 462-pound Vectrix scooter takes two
                   hours to recharge its batteries on 220-volt
                   house current and three hours on a 110-volt
                   current. Its makers say it has a top speed
                   of 62 mph and, when traveling at a constant
                   speed of 40 to 45 mph, has a range of about
                   60 miles on a charge. It is freeway legal
                   and is sold in San Francisco by British Motor
                   Cars. ...But it's the price that gets people. "Eleven
                   thousand dollars? It's bloody insane," said
                   Morris Friedlander, a veteran scooter and
                   motorcycle dealer. ...He said a typical scooter
                   buyer might spend $3,000 or more - sometimes
                   up to $8,000 - for a new gasoline-powered
                   scooter that will run circles around the Vectrix
                   and still get 50 to 80 mpg. After riding the
                   Vectrix, Friedlander said, "the speed
                   is acceptable and the weight is well balanced

                   MONICA DAVEY, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   DEKALB, Ill. - While much of the nation worries
                   about a slumping real estate market, people
                   in Midwestern farm country are experiencing
                   exactly the opposite. Take, for instance,
                   the farm here - nearly 80 acres of corn and
                   soybeans off a gravel road in a universe of
                   corn and soybeans - that sold for $10,000
                   an acre at auction this spring, a price that
                   astonished even the auctioneer.... Skyrocketing
                   farmland prices, particularly in states like
                   Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, giddy with the
                   promise of corn-based ethanol, are stirring
                   new optimism among established farmers. ...Unknown
                   is what will come of land prices if corn loses
                   its place in the ethanol world and is surpassed
                   by another source like cellulosic ethanol
                   from switchgrass.<br />
  "Right now, a lot are still betting that corn-based ethanol
  will be around a while," said Mr. Duffy, who is also the
  director of the Beginning Farmer Center, which assists farmers
  who are starting out. He noted two other farming booms, in
  the 1910s and the 1970s, which were each later followed by
  periods of depression.<br />
  "In five years, corn-based ethanol will be around," Mr.
  Duffy said. "Fifteen years? I'm not as convinced."</span></p>

                   The baking tins and muffin cups lining the
                   countertops in a corner of Ronald Holser's
                   cluttered laboratory were filled with curious
                   substances resembling angel food cakes and
                   loaves of bread. ...The concoctions were prototypes
                   for biodegradable weed barriers and sticky
                   films intended to hold grass seeds on the
                   ground long enough to germinate.<br />
                   If Mr. Holser, a research chemist, and his
                   colleague Steven F. Vaughn, a plant physiologist,
                   are successful, they will have found more
                   than ecologically friendly ways to fight weeds
                   and grow grass.<br />
                   They will have found innovative uses for a
                   byproduct of the production of biodiesel fuel,
                   glycerol. This, in turn, could help transform
                   the biodiesel industry into something that
                   more closely resembles the petroleum industry,
                   where fuel is just one of many profitable
                   products.<br />
  "Just like petroleum refineries make more than one product
  that are the feedstock for other industries, the same will
  have to be true for biofuels," said Kenneth F. Reardon,
  a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Colorado
  State University in Fort Collins. "Biorefining is what
  the vision has to look like in the end."<br />
                   Glycerol is used in a variety of products,
                   including foods, soap and dynamite. But as
                   biodiesel fuel production in the United States
                   has risen, the market for glycerol has become
                   saturated.<br />
                   If scientists like Mr. Holser, ...can expand
                   the number of valuable uses for the syrupy
                   liquid, biodiesel makers could sell their
                   glycerol instead of paying someone to haul
                   it away.<br />
  "Every week I get at least one or two calls from biodiesel
  producers who have all this glycerol and don't know what to
  do with it," Mr. Holser said....</span></p>

                   BATT FabLab: Road to a Better Battery. Science@Berkeley</a>.
                   Contact: Allan Chen,<span> The
                   better transportation battery - a battery
                   for hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles
                   - needs to be lighter than today's battery,
                   store more charge, and last through more charge-discharge
                   cycles. Also, it needs to be safe, affordable,
                   and compact enough to fit under the hood.
                   That's a tall order. Developing a better battery
                   for vehicles requires a multipronged approach
                   to research and development, that of the Department
                   of Energy's BATT program: Batteries for Advanced
                   Transportation Technologies.<br />
                   ...BATT research includes using nanoprobe
                   diagnostics to study advanced battery materials
                   and computer modeling to improve lithium-ion
                   (Li-ion) battery chemistry. Li-ion batteries
                   are of considerable interest because they
                   are lightweight and store more charge per
                   unit weight than those currently used in hybrid
                   electric vehicles.<br />
                   ..."All battery assembly work now takes
                   place inside of glove boxes to keep out water,
                   which is a real killer in lithium-ion batteries," says
                   Battaglia. Water is limited to less than one
                   part per million in the boxes' inert atmosphere;
                   by contrast, the dry rooms in many battery
                   manufacturing facilities limit water in air
                   to 50 parts per million.<br />
                   ...Before lithium-ion batteries can be manufactured
                   economically and meet performance requirements
                   for hybrid vehicles, battery engineers have
                   to learn to control the performance of the
                   electrodes in Li-ion ...battery's lifetime,
                   the number of charge-discharge cycles it can
                   run through before degrading too much to operate,
                   the total amount of charge it can store -
                   which translates directly into vehicle range
                   - and how much charge it can discharge per
                   second - which translates into vehicle acceleration.<br />
                   ...Keeping water out of the battery system
                   is a significant problem for battery engineers.
                   ...Water in a lithium-ion battery reacts with
                   a lithium salt to form an acid, which is thought
                   to attack the cathode, causing its dissolution.<br />
  "We need to know how much water can get into the system
  before the performance begins to degrade," says Battaglia.<br />
                   In the lab's glove boxes, Battaglia's research
                   team manufactures test cells in an extremely
                   low-humidity environment, then introduces
                   water in higher and higher amounts. The researchers
                   measure decrease in battery performance for
                   different kinds of cells. Battery manufacturers,
                   who need cost-effective ways to make batteries
                   without letting in water, are extremely interested
                   in this work....</span></p>

                   Prius Turns Heads - Ferrari of Hybrids</a>.
                   By Michael Taylor, Chronicle Auto Editor (San
                   Francisco Chronicle). <span>Excerpt:
                   It looks pretty much like any other Toyota
                   Prius, sitting in its Redwood City garage,
                   but there is that telltale yellow industrial-strength
                   power cord coming out of its tail and snaking
                   around to a 120-volt electrical outlet.<br />
                   ...The Natural Resources Defense Council and
                   the Electric Power Research Institute, an
                   electrical power industry group, said widespread
                   use of plug-in hybrids, which use little gasoline,
                   would help the environment and reduce oil
                   consumption.<br />
                   ...Toyota said it would provide two factory-made
                   Prius plug-in hybrids to the University of
                   California - at campuses in Berkeley and Irvine
                   - for a two-year test on U.S. roads. The Chronicle's
                   own test drive the other day showed that the
                   plug-in Prius is much like the regular plugless
                   one sold in Toyota showrooms, but with a few
                   tantalizing exceptions. By far, the most arresting
                   (or non-arresting) detail is when you start
                   out driving the plug-in. The car is absolutely
                   silent - that's the electric motor - but when
                   you move down the street, it continues its
                   silence (the regular Prius turns on its engine
                   soon after takeoff). By now, however, you're
                   not caring about electric-this, gasoline-that.
                   You are mesmerized by a dashboard-mounted
                   instrument whose digital readout shows your

                   Taylor, San Francisco Chronicle Staff Writer. <span>Excerpt:
                   Toyota took a big step Wednesday toward marketing
                   plug-in hybrid cars -- vehicles that run mostly
                   on rechargeable batteries and can go 100 miles
                   on a gallon of gas -- when it announced it
                   would provide two specially made Priuses to
                   the University of California for testing on
                   U.S. roads. The Japanese company will be the
                   first major carmaker to put the experimental
                   electric-gas hybrid cars on American streets
                   for daily driving when the Priuses take to
                   the road in Berkeley and Irvine this fall.<br />
                   ...The cars look like normal Priuses, but
                   unlike the showroom model, the experimental
                   version runs mostly on its electric motor
                   and plugs into a 110-volt house current for
                   overnight charging.<br />
                   ...A big problem with developing plug-in hybrid
                   cars historically has been in their batteries.
                   A few small firms that have converted showroom
                   Priuses to plug-ins have done so by removing
                   the car's nickel metal battery and replacing
                   it with a lithium ion battery, twice as powerful
                   as the original. But some lithium ion batteries,
                   particularly those used in laptop computers,
                   have overheated and caught fire. Toyota's
                   experimental hybrids will simply add a second
                   nickel metal battery....</span></p>

                   FUTURE? PLUG IN/Electric hybrid cars hold
                   promise of slashing greenhouse gases</a>.
                   (San Francisco Chronicle) Zachary Coile, Chronicle
                   Washington Bureau. <span>Excerpt:
                   Washington -- ...plug-in hybrid electric cars...
                   with fuel economy that can exceed 100 miles
                   per gallon -- could play a crucial role in
                   fighting global warming and America's addiction
                   to foreign oil. A study released Thursday
                   by the Palo Alto-based Electric Power Research
                   Institute and the Natural Resources Defense
                   Council confirmed...: Hybrid electric cars,
                   if widely adopted in the United States, would
                   yield huge reductions in greenhouse gases
                   over today's fleet of gas-fueled cars and
                   hybrid vehicles. ...If most Americans switched
                   to electric hybrids by 2050, greenhouse gases
                   would be slashed by 450 million metric tons
                   annually -- the equivalent of taking 82.5
                   million cars, about one-third of the U.S.
                   fleet, off the road.... GM is already hyping
                   its concept car, the Chevrolet Volt ...The
                   new vehicles are powered by batteries that
                   can be charged at home but also carry a backup
                   gas tank for longer trips beyond the range
                   of most electric cars. ...The study found
                   that if 60 percent of Americans shifted to
                   plug-in hybrids by 2050, it would lead to
                   an increase in electricity usage of 7 to 8
                   percent -- a relatively small increase, indicating
                   that hybrids would not necessarily require
                   a surge of new power plant construction. Plug-in
                   hybrids are charged mostly at night, when
                   demand for electricity is low. At the same
                   time, the report estimates that electric hybrids
                   would displace the need for 3 ... to 4 million
                   barrels of oil per day by 2050, more than
                   twice what the United States imports each
                   day from Saudi Arabia. ...no matter what energy
                   source was used to produce the electricity,
                   whether coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind
                   or solar... Electric hybrids generated 40
                   to 65 percent less greenhouse gas than gas-fueled
                   vehicles and 7 to 46 percent less than conventional
                   hybrids. ...UC Davis Professor Andrew Frank,
                   whose vehicle design center has produced nine
                   different plug-in concept vehicles, is seen
                   as one of the founders of the movement. ...Comparing

                   Coop America. By Sarah Tarver-Wahlquist. <span>Excerpt:
                   In 2004, Felix Kramer gathered with a group
                   of engineers and car junkies in a friend's
                   garage. Their goal: to make a hybrid car that
                   would plug into the wall, giving it a greater
                   ability to run on electricity.<br />
                   The concept had been pioneered by University
                   of California Davis professor Andrew Frank
                   years before, and with the help of student
                   teams, Frank had built several plug-in electric
                   hybrid prototypes that were generating excitement
                   among environmentalists, engineers, and car
                   lovers. ...Electric vehicle enthusiasts were
                   thrilled by the 2004 Toyota Prius, which was
                   equipped to run solely on battery-stored electricity
                   in Japan, but not in the US. Prius owners
                   across the country started adding extra batteries
                   to the car to increase its electric range,
                   and Kramer gathered together a group of experts
                   to find a way to plug the Prius in. The result
                   was the PRIUS+, a plug-in hybrid electric
                   vehicle that gets over 100 miles to the gallon,
                   puts out half the greenhouse gas emissions
                   of a conventional vehicle, and costs almost
                   half as much per mile to drive.<br />
                   ...Kramer loves educating people about the
                   vehicle, and has seen people responses to
                   a plug-in car evolve from "What is this?" to "Why
                   are carmakers holding back?" Kramer's
                   answer to that last question is that "carmakers
                   are slow to change, and make bad decisions
                   all the time."  He hopes that demonstration
                   cars like the PRIUS+, and other plug-in conversions
                   underway by Hymotion and others will prove
                   the viability of plug-in technology, motivating
                   carmakers to stop dragging their feet....</span></p>

                   transportation wave of the future will include
                   solar-powered ferries with special sunshine-grabbing
                   sails. The first of these "green ferries" in
                   America could be launched in New York Harbor
                   by Circle Line, which has partnered with an
                   Australian shipbuilder to build a $8 million
                   vessel for its Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island
                   route. ...It was while watching a sailboat
                   race along Australia's Gold Coast that the
                   idea for a massive "solar wing" -
                   the vessel's key element - came to Solar Sailor
                   co-founder Robert Dane. The wing can be manipulated
                   into different positions - including folding
                   flat in high winds.... Covered with ray-absorbing,
                   reflective-glass panels, the wing measures
                   50 by 23 feet. Like a large sail, is rotated
                   into position to capture maximum sun- and
                   wind-generated energy....<br />
                   Even on a cloudy day, enough energy is generated
                   to charge the vessel's main batteries and
                   keep the boat running - including its plasma
                   TVs. While the vessel will cost about $2 million
                   more than traditional ferries, Meyer said,
                   it burns one-third less fuel, saving hundreds
                   of thousands annually.... [Hybrid marine power
                   combines electric drives with the power and
                   range of hydrocarbon/alternative fuels. Like
                   the hybrid car; the system is controlled and
                   optimised by a computer. In the case of a
                   hybrid marine power system, renewable energy
                   available on the water such as solar power
                   can also charge batteries and the vessel can
                   sail.]<br />

                   By BARRY REHFELD, New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   JEFF BAUM ... travels 10 miles each way from
                   his home in Frisco, Colo., to his office in
                   Breckenridge - ... 9,800 feet in the Rockies
                   - to his job as the executive director of
                   the Breckenridge Music Festival. For most
                   of his 10 years with the festival, he had
                   driven a standard gasoline-powered sport utility
                   vehicle. Last September, though, he started
                   leaving it at home for something cheaper,
                   quieter and cleaner: an electric bicycle.
                   It takes him a little longer to get to work,
                   but the bike is more dependable, more nimble,
                   more invigorating and just more fun than the
                   S.U.V., he said. "I personally feel very
                   good about it," said Mr. Baum, 53, who
                   spent $7,000 for an Optibike. "[<a href="http://www.optibike.com/">http://www.optibike.com/ </a>]
                   I get the fresh air and, in fact, by switching
                   to the bike, here is one of the few ways in
                   which I as an individual can have a good impact
                   on our environment." Electric bikes ...typically
                   used at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour
                   without pedaling. They can generally cover
                   20 to 50 miles on a battery charge, well within
                   the distance of many daily commutes. ...amid
                   higher fuel prices and deepening worries about
                   the environment, they are emerging as a viable
                   option for commuting, shopping and other local
                   trips. Prices of electric bikes can run from
                   a few hundred dollars for cheap models to
                   $2,000 or more. ...Electric bikes, popular
                   in Asia and Europe, have yet to gain much
                   of a following in the United States. The number
                   sold here is in the tens of thousands a year,
                   compared with 10 million in a recent year
                   in China....The Quando, made by eZee, has

                   LAKEHURST, N.J. ...In dozens of laboratories
                   and research centers, scientists and engineers
                   are busy searching for ways to reduce the
                   cost and improve the practicality of hydrogen-powered
                   vehicles. Development has progressed to the
                   point that some of these prototype vehicles
                   are in daily service, commuting around Detroit,
                   delivering packages in Washington, serving
                   urban bus routes....FORD E-450 SHUTTLE ...In
                   the conversion to hydrogen, some of the passenger
                   area was walled off to house six pressure
                   tanks wrapped in carbon fiber, each rated
                   for storage at 5,000 pounds per square inch.
                   ...this vehicle drives like a bus. The husky
                   V-10 provides ample urge to get the rig rolling
                   briskly. The supercharger sounds like a distant
                   police siren....GENERAL MOTORS HYDROGEN3 ...
                   Under acceleration, the HydroGen3 sounds like
                   an angry golf cart. With only 100 horsepower
                   on tap, it requires more than 15 seconds to

                   and intercooler and produces roughly the same

                   under the Prius's floor are filled with hydrogen
                   by connecting a 1,500 p.s.i. hose to a standard
                   fitting. The tank capacity is 7.9 pounds,

                   The liquid hydrogen offers a 125-mile driving
                   range; when that is consumed, a button on
                   the steering wheel switches the engine over
                   to run on gasoline for 310 more miles from
                   the standard 19.6-gallon gas tank. The engine
                   is tuned to deliver nearly the same power
                   on either fuel. The detuned engine and 500
                   pounds added to carry hydrogen safely impair
                   performance slightly, but the Hydrogen 7's

                   surpass existing fuel-cell vehicles. While
                   running on hydrogen, the only traces of carbon

                   buzzes. ...With only 87 horsepower to move
                   3,380 pounds, acceleration is sluggish. ...the
                   run to 60 m.p.h. takes 15 seconds and a governor
                   limits top speed to 87 m.p.h. ....HONDA FCX

                   computer that produces 100 kilowatts of power.
                   Driving the FCX demonstrated impressive performance:
                   acceleration from zero to 60 m.p.h. takes
                   less than 10 seconds and top speed is more
                   than 90 m.p.h. ...Next year, Honda will begin
                   building the FCX in small numbers for demonstration

                   Push for Ethanol, Without the Corn</a>. By
                   MATTHEW L. WALD and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO. NY
                   Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   JENNINGS, La. ... in October 1998, ... ethanol
                   from crop wastes seemed to be just around
                   the corner. It still is. ...the Energy Department
                   was predicting that ethanol produced from
                   cellulosic waste would be in the market by
                   about 2009 in the same volume as ethanol from
                   the conventional source, corn. But no company
                   has yet been able to produce ethanol from
                   cellulose in mass quantities that are priced
                   competitively with corn-based ethanol. And
                   without the cellulosic ethanol, the national
                   goal for ethanol production will be impossible
                   to reach. "Producing cellulosic ethanol
                   is clearly more difficult than we thought
                   in the 1990s," said Dan W. Reicher, who
                   was assistant secretary of energy efficiency
                   and renewable energy at the time of the first
                   ceremony and who spoke here then. ...If making
                   the technology work to produce ethanol from
                   cellulose was important in the 1990s, it is
                   even more critical now. Because of growing
                   concerns about oil imports and climate change,
                   Mr. Reicher said, "it is essential that
                   we figure this out, and fast."...So why
                   has no one figured out a way to make ethanol
                   from materials like the sugar cane wastes
                   engineers are working with here? In fact,
                   engineers at several companies have done that
                   - but only at the lab level. One company,
                   Iogen, has a pilot plant running in Ottawa
                   and hopes to build a larger operation soon.
                   Abengoa, a Spanish company, says it plans
                   to open a plant in northern Spain late this
                   year, and wants to build a factory in Kansas.
                   Broin Companies, of Sioux Falls, S.D., is
                   planning to expand a corn ethanol plant in
                   Emmetsburg, Iowa, to use cellulose as well.
                   But everyone is still struggling to develop
                   a method that is cost competitive with corn
                   ethanol - not to mention competing with gasoline
                   and other fuels from oil without subsidies.
                   ...The broad concept is the same everywhere.
                   Yeast is used to turn sugar into alcohol,
                   a process learned thousands of years ago.
                   The easiest way to get sugar is from sugar
                   cane. Corn provides carbohydrates, long chains
                   of starch that are easily broken into sugars.
                   Mr. Heissner is hopeful that stems, stalks,
                   wood chips and other materials will replace
                   the corn....</span></p>

                   Foods and ConocoPhillips to Produce Diesel
                   Fuel From Animal Fat</a>. NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   HOUSTON, April 16 - Tyson Foods and ConocoPhillips
                   have cooked up a new recipe for your pickup
                   truck. The two companies announced Monday
                   that they were forming an alliance to produce
                   and market diesel fuel made from pork, poultry
                   and beef fat. It was another sign that farmers
                   and agribusinesses, which are now producing
                   corn for ethanol, will be playing an increasingly
                   large part in the country's energy future.
                   The new brew should be available at the neighborhood
                   filling station by the end of the year. The
                   companies said that the diesel, which will
                   be shipped and distributed through existing
                   pipelines from ConocoPhillips refineries,
                   would burn cleaner than conventional diesel.
                   Much of the feedstock for the fuel will come
                   from several Tyson rendering plants. "This
                   strategic alliance is a big win for the entire
                   agricultural sector because it paves the way
                   for great participation of fats and oils in
                   renewable fuels," said Richard L. Bond,
                   Tyson's president and chief executive....</span></p>

                   Guardian. <span>Excerpt:
                   Oil produced from plants sets up competition
                   for food between cars and people. People -
                   and the environment - will lose....The governments
                   using biofuel to tackle global warming know
                   that it causes more harm than good. But they
                   plough on regardless. In theory, fuels made
                   from plants can reduce the amount of carbon
                   dioxide emitted by cars and trucks. Plants
                   absorb carbon as they grow - it is released
                   again when the fuel is burned. By encouraging
                   oil companies to switch from fossil plants
                   to living ones, governments on both sides
                   of the Atlantic claim to be "decarbonising" our
                   transport networks. ...So what's wrong with
                   these programmes? ...Already we know that
                   biofuel is worse for the planet than petroleum.

                   that 98% of the natural rainforest in Indonesia
                   will be degraded or gone by 2022. Just five
                   years ago, the same agencies predicted that

                   environmental groups charged up about plug-in
                   hybrids</a>. By Matt Nauman, Mercury News. <span>Excerpt:
                   From Silicon Valley to China, the groundwork
                   is being laid for plug-in hybrid vehicles
                   that get more of their power from electricity
                   and less from gasoline. In Palo Alto on Thursday,
                   Plug-in Bay Area, a coalition that includes
                   the Rainforest Action Network, Bluewater Network,
                   CalCars, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and others,
                   and the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, led
                   by Carl Guardino, announced a partnership
                   to support plug-ins hybrids. Nothing specific
                   was unveiled at the event, but those present,
                   including Palo Alto Mayor Yoriko Kishimoto,
                   pledged to work to encourage local companies
                   and governments to show their support of plug-ins
                   by placing "soft orders" for them.
                   Soft orders are public statements of support
                   for the concept; no company is mass-producing
                   plug-in hybrids yet. About two dozen plug-in
                   hybrids exist in the United States. Like a
                   traditional hybrid, plug-ins have both electric
                   motors and batteries as well as a gasoline
                   engine. The difference, advocates say, is
                   that plug-ins have more robust batteries,
                   which allow them to achieve the equivalent
                   of 100 mpg. And they can be charged using
                   a home's electricity. Also Thursday, automotive
                   entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin revealed in
                   a phone interview more about his plans to
                   build plug-ins in China and sell them in the
                   United States. He intends to build four-door
                   models costing about $35,000 that can go 40
                   to 50 miles on electricity and then use a

                   DIVERSION OF U.S. GRAIN TO FUEL CARS IS RAISING
                   WORLD FOOD PRICES</a>. By Lester R. Brown.

                   If you think you are spending more each week
                   at the supermarket, you may be right. The
                   escalating share of the U.S. grain harvest
                   going to ethanol distilleries is driving up
                   food prices worldwide. Corn prices have doubled
                   over the last year, wheat futures are trading
                   at their highest level in 10 years, ...Some
                   16 percent of the 2006 U.S. grain harvest
                   was used to produce ethanol. With 80 or so
                   ethanol distilleries now under construction,
                   enough to more than double existing ethanol
                   production capacity, nearly a third of the
                   2008 grain harvest will be going to ethanol.
                   ...There are alternatives to this grim scenario.
                   A rise in auto fuel efficiency standards of
                   20 percent, phased in over the next decade
                   would save as much oil as converting the entire
                   U.S. grain harvest into ethanol. One option
                   that is gaining momentum is a shift to plug-in
                   hybrids. Adding a second storage battery to
                   a gas-electric hybrid car along with a plug-in
                   capacity so that the batteries can be recharged
                   at night allows most short-distance driving--daily
                   commuting and grocery shopping, for example--to
                   be done with electricity. ...cars could run
                   largely on electricity for the equivalent
                   cost of $1 per gallon gasoline....</span></p>

                   Gets You Nowhere.</a> <span>Would you drive a car
                   that gets zero miles to the gallon? Of course
                   not. Yet that is your mileage whenever your
                   engine idles. Idling wastes money and fuel,
                   contributes to air pollution, and generates
                   carbon dioxide emissions that cause global
                   warming. ...Unfortunately, many people believe
                   that idling is necessary or even beneficial-a
                   false perception that has carried over from
                   the 1970s and 1980s, when engines needed time
                   to warm up (especially in colder temperatures).
                   Fuel-injection vehicles, which have been the
                   norm since the mid-1980s, can be restarted
                   frequently without engine damage and need
                   no more than 30 seconds to warm up even on
                   winter days. ...idling longer than that could
                   actually damage your engine in the long term...
                   leaving residues in the engine that can contaminate
                   engine oil and make spark plugs dirty. ....No
                   matter what time of year, minimize your idling
                   with the following tips: When first starting
                   your car, idle for no more than 30 seconds.
                   Except when sitting in traffic, turn your
                   engine off if you must wait in your car for
                   more than 30 seconds. You can still operate
                 the radio and windows without the engine running.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><a name="2006"></a>2006</p>

                     from Alan Gould: The clip is good for discussion
                     purposes. It has a serious flaw at the end
                     where the gentleman implies that it runs
                     on seawater and has water as it's only exhaust.
                     The latter is essentially true, but the
                     former is false. It's conceivable to develop
                     a system where seawater could be electrolyzed
                     to produce H2 but the only systems I know
                     of currently use fresh water. In any case
                     it requires an electrical energy source.
                     Ideally that would be renewable energy source
                     from wind, solar, tidal, and so forth, but
                     many people are saying that we'll continue
                     to burn fossil fuel for electricity. There
                     is also a way to extract H2 from fossil
                     fuel, a process called "reforming".
                     At the GM website, <a href="http://www.gm.com/company/gmability/adv_tech/400_fcv/index.html">http://www.gm.com/company/gmability/adv_tech/400_fcv/index.html</a><br />
                   they say, "...four important challenges
                   must be addressed before practical fuel cell
                   use can become a reality. They are hydrocarbon
                   fuel reforming, storage, cost and infrastructure
                   development." No mention of using renewable
                   energy systems to generate H2.</span></p>

                     Monterey County race track Tuesday in the
                     form of a dark red sedan that is slated
                     to be the first fuel cell car on the planet
                     to come off a production line. The Honda
                     FCX looks like a slightly futuristic version
                     of a blend of cars, especially those made
                     by Honda Motor Co. ... Honda says that within
                     two years it plans to produce and lease
                     to the public an untold number of cars based
                     on the concept car the company put on display
                     Tuesday. Tentative plans call for leasing
                     the car for perhaps $600 or $700 a month.
                     Automakers typically lease experimental

                     Daniels to Look Beyond Corn for Fuel Sources</a>.
                     By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     CHICAGO, Nov. 8 - Archer Daniels Midland's
                     new chief executive outlined a broad strategy
                     Wednesday for the company to dominate the
                     growing bioenergy industry, but offered
                     few specifics on how it would carry out
                     that vision. Patricia A. Woertz, who took
                     over in May, said A.D.M., the grain-processing
                     giant, would seek to maintain its leadership
                     in biofuels, like ethanol, by diversifying
                     its production sources beyond corn. The
                     plan includes possible investments in Brazil
                     to make sugar for ethanol and in Indonesia
                     to make palm oil for biodiesel, as well
                     as export opportunities for biofuels in
                     India and elsewhere. ...The company plans
                     to expand its ethanol capacity in the United
                     States to 1.6 billion gallons a year by
                     the end of 2008, from 1.1 billion gallons
                     a year now. Ms. Woertz also said A.D.M.
                     would look to invest in so-called cellulosic
                     ethanol made from agricultural waste and
                     nonfood crops. But she and other company
                     officials declined to say which kind of
                     crop A.D.M. favored for such production.
                     ...A.D.M., which processes corn, soybeans
                     and other crops into vegetable oils and
                     products like high-fructose corn syrup,
                     ethanol and biodiesel, has had record sales
                     and profits the last two years. That growth
                     has been driven largely by high ethanol
                     prices, which topped $4.20 a gallon this
                     summer. Global demand for food will more
                     than double by 2050, and by then traditional
                     energy supplies will be inadequate to meet
                     demand, Ms. Woertz said. Demand for ethanol
                     and biodiesel is growing more quickly than
                     production capacity in both the United States
                     and Europe, she said. Only 47 percent of
                     gasoline today is blended with ethanol,
                     Edward Harjehausen, a senior vice president
                     at A.D.M., said Wednesday....</span></p>

                     New York Times. By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO. <span>Excerpt:
                     MALTA BEND, Mo. - Farmers do not see fast
                     money very often. But with big profits gushing
                     forth from ethanol plants, dozens of Wall
                     Street bankers, in loafers and suits, have
                     been descending on the cornfields of the
                     Midwest promising to make thousands of farmers
                     rich overnight.<br />
                     Most of them, though, are proving surprisingly
                     reluctant to cash in.<br />
                     In this sleepy town of 250, for example,
                     people have lived on the edge of despair
                     for decades, dreaming of a way to make their
                     corn worth more than $2 a bushel. Seeking
                     a way out, a group of farmers from here
                     and surrounding communities scoured the
                     state three years ago to raise the money
                     for a $60 million plant that would turn
                     some of their corn into ethanol for cars
                     and lift their incomes.<br />
                     When ethanol prices soared to more than
                     $4 a gallon this summer, the plant became
                     a roaring success.<br />
                     And that is when the big money types came
                     knocking. New offers - some as high as $275
                     million - have rolled in just about every
                     week from an investment bank or hedge fund
                     seeking to buy the plant. For the farmers,
                     particularly those who borrowed part of
                     their investment, a sale could have meant
                     a profit of as much as 10 times what they
                     put in.<br />
                     So far, however, the plant owners have said
                     no. To them - and to many other farmers
                     who have invested in ethanol around the
                     country - the ethanol plants represent more
                     than a winning lottery ticket. Instead,
                     they signify an emotional investment in
                     the future of their farms and communities,
                     a chance for greater independence and a
                     sense of pride that they are helping make
                     America less dependent on foreign oil....<br />
                     ..."I have been farming for 50 years
                     and this is something we have been waiting
                     for all our lives: a way to increase the
                     value of our agricultural commodities," said
                     Marvin Oerke, 66, another board member. "I

                   ...Ethanol offers many of the same benefits
                   as gasoline and diesel, including ease of
                   handling and storage, but it is typically
                   blended with gasoline because ethanol does
                   not evaporate well at cold temperatures-making
                   it hard to start a car running on pure ethanol
                   in cold weather. All of today's gasoline-burning
                   cars and trucks can use a blend of 10 percent
                   ethanol (known as E10) or less without any
                   engine modifications; E10 accounts for more
                   than 99 percent of all fuel ethanol consumed
                   in the United States.<br />
...Almost 20 years ago, in an effort to stimulate alternative-fuel
use and reduce oil dependence, Congress created an incentive
program that gives manufacturers of flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs)
credit for higher fuel economy, under the assumption that vehicles
running on ethanol blends reduce total gasoline consumption.
The incentive assumes FFVs use E85 half the time; however, today's
FFVs use E85 only about one percent of the time. As a result,
automakers are getting much more credit than they deserve.<br />
...Blends of 85 percent ethanol, known as E85, can be used in "flex-fuel" vehicles
(FFVs) designed to run on gasoline or any current ethanol blend....<br />
From an air quality perspective, E85 is preferable to E10. E85
produces higher emissions of toxic formaldehyde and acetaldehyde
but lower overall emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs,
a key precursor to smog) than either E10 or pure gasoline. E10
actually produces higher VOC emissions than pure gasoline.<br />
...While ethanol will not decrease the number of visits to the
fuel pump, there is no question that it has a positive role to
play in helping to reduce our petroleum dependence and the risks
of dangerous global warming. But in the near term, we can achieve
the greatest oil and consumer savings by improving the fuel economy
of new vehicles. These efficiency gains will help lower the costs
of an ethanol future.</span></p>

                     (NY Times): Dozens of factories that turn
                     corn into the gasoline substitute ethanol
                     are sprouting up across the nation, from
                     Tennessee to Kansas, and California, often
                     in places hundreds of miles away from where
                     corn is grown. ...The modern-day gold rush
                     is driven by a number of factors: generous
                     government subsidies, surging demand for
                     ethanol as a gasoline supplement, a potent
                     blend of farm-state politics and the prospect
                     of generating more than a 100 percent profit
                     in less than two years. The rush is taking
                     place despite concerns that large-scale
                     diversion of agricultural resources to fuel
                     could result in price increases for food
                     for people and livestock, as well as the
                     transformation of vast preserved areas into
                     farmland. ...Despite continuing doubts about
                     whether the fuel provides a genuine energy
                     saving, at least 39 new ethanol plants are
                     expected to be completed over the next 9
                     to 12 months, projects that will push the
                     United States past Brazil as the world's
                     largest ethanol producer. The new plants
                     will add 1.4 billion gallons a year, a 30
                     percent increase over current production
                     of 4.6 billion gallons, according to Dan
                     Basse, president of AgResources, an economic
                     forecasting firm in Chicago. By 2008, analysts
                     predict, ethanol output could reach 8 billion
                     gallons a year. ...But many energy experts
                     are also questioning the benefits of ethanol
                     to the nation's fuel supply. While it is
                     a renewable, domestically produced fuel
                     that reduces gasoline pollution, large amounts
                     of oil or natural gas go into making ethanol
                     from corn, leaving its net contribution
                     to reducing the use of fossil fuels much
                     in doubt. ..."The cost of the alternative
                     - of staying addicted to oil and filling
                     our atmosphere with greenhouse gases, and
                     keeping other countries beholden to high
                     gasoline prices - is unacceptable," said
                     Nathanael Greene, senior policy analyst
                     at the Natural Resources Defense Council
                     in New York. "We have to struggle through

                     rib-eye steak hasn't been the hardest part
                     for Ana Lopez, although her husband is a
                     red-meat man. Ana Lopez, housekeeping manager
                     at the Bentley Hotel, worries about paying
                     $60 a week to fill the tank for her 60-mile
                     round trip to work. More difficult are having
                     to tell her 11-year-old son that he cannot
                     go to the movies, and swearing off Sunday
                     visits to her sister in Pembroke Pines or
                     to her brother in Miami Lakes. These are
                     the sacrifices required now that it costs
                     $60 to fill her aging Toyota 4Runner. ...As
                     many drivers struggle to cope with soaring
                     fuel prices, working-class people like Ms.
                     Lopez who commute long distances to their
                     jobs are suffering the most. In many cases,
                     they had moved far away from major metropolitan
                     areas to be able to afford decent houses.
                     Now, paradoxically, the cost of gas is making
                     the distance prohibitively expensive. ...Aline
                     Lacombe, who travels from Palm Beach County
                     to her job as a legal assistant at the Justice
                     Department in downtown Miami, has stopped
                     driving altogether. As a result, her commute
                     now includes two train rides and a shuttle,
                     and takes close to two hours each way, at
                     least twice what it used to. "It's
                     a nightmare," said Ms. Lacombe, a 39-year-old
                     mother of three children under 10. She is
                     also losing sleep because of the longer
                     commute: wake-up time is 5:20 a.m. now;
                     it used to be 7. For Ms. Lacombe, gasoline
                     costs used to be about $100 a week, about
                     11 percent of her $45,000 annual salary;
                     that figure is closer to $200 a week now.<br />
                     For Ms. Lopez, driving to and from work
                     used to cost $30 a week; now it costs $80.
                     With an annual income of $32,000, that means
                     nearly 13 percent of her income goes for
                     gas, instead of about 5 percent, as in the
                     past. ...Ms. Lopez could try to car-pool.

                     Several months of rising gasoline prices
                     appear to be deflating some of the enthusiasm
                     American consumers exhibited at the start
                     of the year. ..."It's pretty clear

                     Economics. 
                     "The big question is, How much of an
                     impact has it had on spending?" The
                     answer to that question is not obvious.
                     Nor is it clear that the economy will suffer
                     from a slowdown in spending, as long as
                     it remains relatively modest. Indeed, it
                     could be a benefit. That is because the
                     Federal Reserve is counting on the recent
                     economic boom to cool off enough that it
                     can take a breather in its two-year campaign
                     of raising interest rates to keep inflation
                     in check. For now, the signals are mixed.

                     cope with higher gasoline costs. Ross Edwards,
                     a corporate project manager from Pittsburgh,

                     DETROIT, - General Motors is preparing to
                     give a final salute to the hulking Hummer
                     H1, the ultimate in sport utility might
                     and, to its many critics, the ultimate in
                     environmental incorrectness. About 12,000
                     H1's have been sold to the public, and the
                     current price is around $140,000. G.M. said
                     Friday that it expected to stop building
                     the H1, flagship of its Hummer line, next
                     month. The move comes 14 years after it
                     first went on sale to the public. The H1,
                     originally called simply the Hummer, and
                     lately known as the H1 Alpha, is derived
                     from the military vehicle called the Humvee.
                     ... G.M. has added two slightly smaller
                     Hummers, the stately H2, introduced in 2002
                     and the relatively petite H3, which went
                     on sale last year. Perhaps because there
                     are more choices of Hummers, or because
                     H1's moment of military chic simply has
                     passed because of the conflict overseas,
                     sales of the H1 have plummeted. ...With
                     diesel fuel prices around $3 a gallon, it
                     costs more than $150 to fill up the H1's
                     two gas tanks, which together hold 51.5
                     gallons. And with G.M. on a push to recast
                     its image as a green company, "it's
                     time for it to go away," Mr. Pinelli
                     said of the biggest Hummer. Environmentalists,
                     who have used the H1 as an automotive punching
                     bag since it first heaved onto American
                     streets, could hardly contain themselves. "It's
                     one thing if it's carrying soldiers to and
                     from a fight," said Daniel Becker of
                     the Sierra Club, which maintains an anti-Hummer
                     Web page called "Hummerdinger.org." "It's
                     another if it's hauling lattes home from
                     Starbucks." 
                     For its part, G.M. said high fuel prices
                     were not the reason it pulled the plug on
                     the H1. ...</span></p>

                     Power Put to the Test</a>. By MATTHEW L.
                     WALD, NY Times.<span> Excerpt:
                     AMES, Iowa - The endless fields of corn
                     in the Midwest can be distilled into endless
                     gallons of ethanol, a clean-burning, high-octane
                     fuel that could end any worldwide oil shortage,
                     reduce emissions that cause global warming,
                     and free the United States from dependence
                     on foreign energy. ...There is only one
                     catch: Turning corn into ethanol takes energy.
                     For every gallon that an ethanol manufacturing
                     plant produces, it uses the equivalent of
                     almost two-fifths of a gallon of fuel (usually
                     natural gas), and that does not count the
                     fuel needed to make fertilizer for the corn,
                     run the farm machinery or truck the ethanol
                     to market. The use of all that fossil fuel
                     to make ethanol substantially reduces its
                     value as an alternative source of energy.
                     Not that ethanol is useless.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><a name="2005"></a><span>2005</span></p>

                   Lines Set as New York Acts to Cut Emissions</a>.
                   By DANNY HAKIM, NY Times.<span> Excerpt:
                   ALBANY, Nov. 23 - New York is adopting California's
                   ambitious new regulations aimed at cutting
                   automotive emissions of global warming gases,
                   touching off a battle over rules that would
                   sharply reduce carbon dioxide emissions while
                   forcing the auto industry to make vehicles
                   more energy efficient over the next decade.
                   Stricter automotive rules are intended to
                   curb greenhouse gas emissions from traffic-choked
                   places like the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
                   ... But the auto industry has already moved
                   to block the rules in New York State, and
                   plans to battle them in every other state
                   that follows suit. Environmentalists say the
                   regulations will not lead to the extinction
                   of any class of vehicle, but simply pressure
                   the industry to sell more of the fuel-saving
                   technologies they have already developed,
                   including hybrid systems that use a combination
                   of electricity and gasoline. And that, they
                   say, will curtail one of the main contributors
                   to global warming. "The two biggest contributors
                   to global warming are power plants and motor
                   vehicles," 
                   said David Doniger, a senior lawyer for the
                   Natural Resources Defense Council. "If
                   you deal with them, you deal with more than
                   two-thirds of the problem." 
                   But automakers contend that the regulations
                   will limit the availability of many sport
                   utility vehicles, pickup trucks, vans and
                   larger sedans, since they will effectively
                   require huge leaps in gas mileage to rein
                   in emissions. The industry also says the rules
                   will force them to curb sales of more-powerful
                   engines in the state, and ultimately harm
                   consumers by increasing the cost of vehicles.
                   The standards ...will be phased in starting
                   with 2009 models and require a roughly 30
                   percent reduction in automotive emissions
                   of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
                   by the 2016 models. The new rules will also
                   effectively require an improvement in fuel
                   economy on the order of 40 percent for vehicles
                   sold in the state. Ten states follow or plan
                   to follow California's air quality rules,...If
                   all 10 states and California succeed in enacting
                   the rules, they will form a powerful alternative
                   regulatory bloc accounting for about a third
                   of the nation's auto sales. "That is
                   so much of the market it should reach a tipping
                   point," Mr. Doniger said. "It won't
                   make sense for the automakers to build two
                   fleets, one clean and one dirty."</span></p>

                   Hydrogen Car Research</a>. by David Pescovitz. <span>While
                   eco-friendly hybrid automobiles gain popularity,
                   researchers are already developing cars with
                   no emissions at all. Powered by hydrogen fuel

                   distances with only water dribbling out of
                   the exhaust pipe. The path to the hydrogen
                   economy isn't smoothly paved though. One big
                   question is whether a safe and practical hydrogen
                   storage system can be built to store enough
                   fuel for long journeys. To that end, UC Berkeley

                   Tests Solid Storage in Prius Hybrid</a><br />
                 by Dean Stanley. Rochester Hills, MICH. --<span> Driving
                   the ECD-Ovonics' hydrogen-fueled Toyota Prius
                   hybrid, one thing becomes quite obvious: there
                   is virtually no performance difference from
                   the gasoline version, and that's exactly what
                   ECD-Ovonics is shooting for. Less obvious
                 is the company's solid hydrogen storage system,
                   which currently yields a nearly 200-mile driving
                   range while taking up no more space than the
                   original Prius gasoline tank. Of course, 200
                   miles is a far cry from the Prius' 600-plus
                   range, but it's a start. ... a solid hydrogen
                   storage system, retrofitted turbocharger,
                 gaseous fuel delivery system, plus modified
                 ignition and fuel metering software. ...Emissions
                 is also an area where the hydrogen ICE improves
                   on the already ultra clean gasoline hybrid.
                   By employing hydrogen as a fuel, the ECD-Ovonics
                   Prius produces less hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide
                   and carbon dioxide emissions than its gasoline
                   counterpart. In fact, carbon dioxide output
                   - due entirely to the burning of trace amounts
                   of engine lubricants - is reduced to less
                 than 1.5 percent of that produced by the gasoline
                   version. Of course, the ECD-Ovonic Prius is
                   really a test bed for the company's solid
                 hydrogen storage system, which uses a proprietary
                 mix of powdered metals - nearly a dozen different
                   materials - an internal heat exchanger, a
                 small electric heater (for cold starts), plus
                 an arrangement of internal baffles to keep the
                 metal powder distributed and to avoid any caking
                 within the tank. ... the eight-minute filling
                 time is still            lengthy. Dynetek produces the tanks for ECD-Ovonics,
                   using one of their carbon-fiber-wound, aluminum-lined
                   CNG tanks as a starting point. ...cycle life
                   of the solid storage system is not a concern,
                   according to Schmidt. "We've cycled canisters
                   over 500 cycles and have no degradation of the
                   powder, or very minimal at most, so the capacity
                   of the tank would not be changed," he
                   states.</span></p>

                   produce hydrogen from sources such as biomass
                   or hydrocarbon fuels. The private company,
                   Intelligent Energy, was formed in 2001, immediately
                   acquiring the R&amp;D company that had prototyped

                   bike coupled with more of a motorcycle feel
                   because of the added weight of four 12-volt

                   July 21, 2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
                   signed Senate Bill 76 (SB 76) that provided
                   the necessary funding and legislative guidelines
                   to implement recommendations of the CA H2
                   Net Blueprint Plan. SB 76 is a budget trailer
                   bill that provides $6.5 million in funding
                   for state-sponsored hydrogen demonstration
                   projects until January 1, 2007. The funds
                   may be used for co-funding the establishment
                   of up to three hydrogen fueling station demonstration
                   projects and the State lease and purchase
                   of a variety of hydrogen fueled vehicles.</span></p>

                   Cars Burning Gas in the Drive for Power</a>.
                   By Matthew L. Wald.<span> Surprisingly,
                   hybrid technology is being used to satisfy
                   the American appetite for acceleration and
                   bulk. Many people concerned with oil consumption
                   ... are pointing to hybrids - vehicles with
                   electric motors as well as internal combustion
                   engines - as a way to reduce fuel use and
                   dependence on imported oil. The first ones
                   to reach the market did that; the two-seat
                   Honda Insight, introduced in December 1999,
                   was rated at 70 miles per gallon, and it was
                   followed by the five-seat Toyota Prius, also
                   built for reduced fuel consumption. ...But
                   the pendulum has swung. The 2005 Honda Accord
                   hybrid gets about the same miles per gallon
                   as the basic four-cylinder model, according
                   to a review by Consumer Reports, a car-buyer's
                   guide, and it saves only about two miles a
                   gallon compared with the V-6 model on which
                   it is based. Thanks to the hybrid technology,
                   though, it accelerates better. Hybrid technology,
                   it seems, is being used in much the same way
                   as earlier under-the-hood innovations that
                   increased gasoline efficiency: to satisfy
                   the American appetite for acceleration and
                   bulk....Consumer Reports, in an article published
                   in May, found that in actual on-the-road conditions
                   the Accord hybrid averaged 25 m.p.g., versus
                   24 m.p.g. for the 4-cylinder model and 23
                   m.p.g. for the nonhybrid V-6.</span></p>

<span>For
                                a decade or longer, the fuel-cell
                                car has resembled the mirage
                                that recedes as you draw closer
                                to it. Hydrogen-powered vehicles
                                always seemed at least 20 years
                                away, the subject of news conferences
                                in Washington and static displays
                                at auto shows. Even when test-drive
                                opportunities came up, they were
                                strictly controlled rides around
                                a track, with nervous company
                                representatives making excuses
                                from the passenger seat. All
                                that changed last month when
                                Honda handed me the keys to a
                                2005 edition of its FCX (for
                                Fuel Cell Experimental), the
                                first zero-emission, hydrogen-driven
                                vehicle to be certified by both
                                the Environmental Protection
                                Agency and the State of California
                                for everyday commercial use.
                                This is a street-ready hydrogen
                                car with license plates and no
                                rough edges, a test bed for green
                                technology worth well over $1
                                million... The main hydrogen
                                components are hidden: an 86-kilowatt
                                fuel cell under the front passenger
                                area, two tanks (holding a total
                                of 8.3 pounds, pressurized to
                                5,000 pounds per square inch)
                                under the rear seat and the ultracapacitor
                                (which stores electricity and
                                takes the place of a battery
                                pack) behind a cover in the cargo
                                area. Although top speed is only
                                93 miles an hour, the low-end
                                torque of the 80-kilowatt electric
                                motor is substantial, booting
                                the little car off the line with
                                alacrity. The 107 horsepower
                                has to move a relatively weighty
                                3,700 pounds, so it takes about
                                11 seconds to accelerate to 60
                                miles an hour, but there is no
                                noticeable lag or flat spots
                                in the power delivery... Getting
                                under way in the FCX is a little
                                different. You turn the key and
                                a "system check" message
                                appears on a dashboard display,
                                followed (in five to eight seconds)
                                by a "ready to drive" message.
                                You just drop the normal-looking
                                shifter into drive - the car
                                has a single-speed transmission
                                - and take off...</span></p>

                   enjoy oil dependency with a clean conscience.
                   They're making their own auto fuel out of
                   cooking grease. A small but mighty group of
                   concerned motorists has curtailed (even eliminated)
                   its fossil fuel usage by switching to biofuels.
                   This counterculture movement runs vehicles
                   on biodiesel as an act of protest against
                   the war in the Middle East and a strategy
                   to help stem global warming. But locating
                   both a source of biofuel and a diesel vehicle

                   of an Executive order creating a public and
                   private partnership to build a Hydrogen Highway
                   in California by 2010. At a ceremony at UC
                   Davis, he christened Station #1 on California
                   Hydrogen Highway by fueling a hydrogen fuel
                   cell vehicle at the pump. </span>

                   Power</a>. By Jane Braxton Little, for On
                   Earth (NRDC). <span>Excerpt:
                   ...By 2030, China could overtake the United
                   States as the world's leading greenhouse gas
                   emitter. This is a fate that Finamore wants
                   to help China avoid. 
                   "We can't deny the Chinese people their
                   desire to live more comfortably," she
                   says. "We just hope to find ways to do
                   that without the environmental impacts." ...Finamore,
                   who has lived on and off in China for more
                   than a decade, is optimistic. "China
                   wants cleaner energy," she says. ...in
                   Jiangsu,... Finamore was among those who helped
                   the local government design a fund-the first
                   of its kind in China-that pays factories to
                   buy energy-efficient equipment. This, in turn,
                   reduces electricity consumption at peak times. "The
                   very notion that you can legislate clean energy
                   is new in China," she says. ...In Beijing,
                   an eight-story office building that captures
                   rainwater for irrigation and solar heats water
                   will soon open; it is China's first building
                   certified to meet international green-construction
                   standards. Shanghai manufacturers and a Canadian
                   company, brought together by Finamore, hope
                   to begin production of fuel-cell scooters,
                   which could cut down on urban pollution. And
                   China is investing research money in coal-gasification,
                   which would produce electricity, hydrogen,
                   and liquid fuels with near-zero emissions...</span></p><p><br /></p><p><a name="2003"></a><span>2003</span></p>

                   Set to Act on Fuel Economy</a>. By KEITH BRADSHER,
                   Associated Press -- <span>With
                   car ownership in Chinese cities growing, traffic
                   clogged a Beijing perimeter road last month.
                   The Chinese government is preparing to impose
                   minimum fuel economy standards on new cars
                   for the first time, and the rules will be
                   significantly more stringent than those in
                   the United States, according to Chinese experts
                   involved in drafting them. The new standards
                   are intended both to save energy and to force
                   automakers to introduce the latest hybrid
                   engines and other technology in China, in
                   hopes of easing the nation's swiftly rising
                   dependence on oil imports from volatile countries
                   in the Middle East.... Some popular vehicles
                   now built in China by Western automakers,
                   including the Chevrolet Blazer, do not measure
                   up to the standards the government has drafted,
                   and may have to be modified to get better
                   gas mileage before the first phase of the
                   new rules becomes effective in July 2005.
                   The Chinese initiative comes at a time when
                   Congress is close to completing work on a
                   major energy bill that would make no significant
                   changes in America's fuel economy rules for
                   vehicles. The Chinese standards, in general,
                   call for new cars, vans and sport utility
                   vehicles to get as much as two miles a gallon
                   of fuel more in 2005 than the average required
                   in the United States, and about five miles
                   more in 2008. </span></font></p>
