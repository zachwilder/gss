                   Meets Polar as Winter Curbs Clean Energy.</a> By
                   Kate Galbraith. <span>Excerpt:
                   Old Man Winter, it turns out, is no friend
                   of renewable energy.This time of year, wind
                   turbine blades ice up, biodiesel congeals
                   in tanks and solar panels produce less power
                   because there is not as much sun. And perhaps
                   most irritating to the people who own them,
                   the panels become covered with snow, rendering
                   them useless even in bright winter sunshine...As
                   concern has grown about global warming, many
                   utilities and homeowners have been trying
                   to shrink their emissions of carbon dioxide — their
                   carbon footprints — by installing solar
                   panels, wind turbines and even generators
                   powered by tides or rivers. But for the moment,
                   at least, the planet is still cold enough
                   to deal nasty winter blows to some of this
                   green machinery.</span>..<span>The
                   wind industry admits that turbines can drop
                   ice, like a lamppost or any tall structure.
                   To ameliorate the hazard, some turbines are
                   painted black to absorb sunlight and melt
                   the ice faster. But Ron Stimmel, an expert
                   on small wind turbines at the American Wind
                   Energy Association, denies that the whirling
                   blades tend to hurl icy javelins.Large turbines
                   turn off automatically as ice builds up, and
                   small turbines will slow and stop because
                   the ice prevents them from spinning — “just
                   like a plane’s wing needs to be de-iced
                   to fly,” Mr. Stimmel said.Mr. Brokaw
                   says that his turbines do turn off when they
                   are too icy, but the danger sometimes comes
                   right before the turbines shut down, after
                   a wet, warm snow causes ice buildup.From the
                   standpoint of generating power, winter is
                   actually good for wind turbines, because it
                   is generally windier than summer. In Vermont,
                   for example, Green Mountain Power, which operates
                   a small wind farm in the southeastern part
                   of the state, gets more than twice the monthly
                   production in winter as in August.The opposite
                   is true, however, for solar power. Days are
                   shorter and the sun is lower in the sky during
                   the winter, ensuring less power production...</span></p>
<p>2008 October 6. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/science/07tier.html?ref=science" target="_blank">A
                   Gift From the ’70s: Energy Lessons.</a> By
                   John Tierny, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   The presidential candidates claim to see America’s
                   energy future, but their competing visions
                   have a certain vintage quality. They’ve
                   revived that classic debate: the hard path
                   versus the soft path.<br />
                   The soft path, as Amory Lovins defined it
                   in the 1970s, is energy conservation and power
                   from the sun, wind and plants — the
                   technologies that Senator Barack Obama emphasizes
                   in his plan to reduce greenhouse emissions.
                   Senator John McCain is more enthusiastic about
                   building nuclear power plants, the quintessential
                   hard path.<br />
                   As a rule, it’s not a good idea to revive
                   anything from the 1970s. But this debate is
                   the exception, and not just because the threat
                   of global warming has raised the stakes. The
                   old lessons are as good a guide as any to
                   the future, as William Tucker argues in “Terrestrial
                   Energy,” his history of the hard-soft
                   debate.<br />
                   ...Today about 20 percent of electricity in
                   America is generated by nuclear power, which
                   is about 20 times the contribution from solar
                   and wind power. Nuclear power also costs less,
                   according to Gilbert Metcalf, an economist
                   at Tufts University. After estimating the
                   costs and factoring out the hefty tax breaks
                   for different forms of low-carbon energy,
                   he estimates that new nuclear plants could
                   produce electricity more cheaply than windmills,
                   solar power or “clean coal” plants....<br />
                   ..."The nuclear debate is still stuck
                   back in the 1980s," says Mr. Tucker,
                   the author of "Terrestrial Energy,"
                   the new brand he's trying to affix to nuclear
                   power. If people started associating nuclear
                   plants with natural radioactive processes
                   in the Earth instead of atomic bombs, he says,
                   they might be persuaded that it's the most
                   environmentally benign form of energy.</span>...</p>

                   Redux - Climate Change Forces a Reexamination
                   of Nuclear Power.</a> By AMY KISER, Terrain
                   Magazine. <span>Excerpt:
                   For the last several decades, "no nukes" has
                   been the mantra of environmentalists and a
                   no-brainer for many US citizens. The generation
                   of nuclear power involved impossible-to-ignore
                   environmental risks, horribly obvious after
                   Three Mile Island and Chernobyl....plants
                   could suffer meltdowns, and safe storage options
                   for spent fuel were questionable. <br />
                   Plans to build new nuclear power plants ground
                   to a halt in many countries, including the
                   US, partially due to bad publicity and the
                   enormous expense of plant construction.<br />
                   But then ... global warming took center stage....
                   The need to transition away from burning fossil
                   fuels became paramount, and some environmentalists
                   began to reconsider nuclear power as a necessary
                   and even preferable part of the energy portfolio.<br />
                   ...The Energy Commission found that a complete
                   life-cycle analysis of nuclear power reveals
                   that its greenhouse gas emissions are comparable
                   to wind, solar voltaics, and geothermal technologies.<br />
                   ...The radioactive spent fuel left over from
                   generating nuclear power is one of its greatest
                   liabilities, but some argue that radioactive
                   waste-because it is contained-is better than
                   the byproducts of burning coal. ... In 1993,
                   nuclear physicist Alex Gabbard of Oak Ridge
                   National Laboratory wrote in a seminal article, 
  "Overall, nuclear power produces far less waste material
  than fossil-fuel based power plants. Coal-burning plants are
  particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and
  mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring
  metals and radioactive material from the coal. Contrary to
  popular belief, coal power actually results in more radioactive
  waste being released into the environment than nuclear power.
  The population effective dose equivalent from radiation from
  coal plants is 100 times as much as nuclear plants."<br />
                   Admittedly, comparing anything to coal sets
                   a pretty low bar. ...The US nuclear power
                   industry gets much of its fuel from Russia's
                   decommissioned nuclear weapons.<br />
                   ... a large quantity of intermediate-level
                   waste is created, and deep repositories like

                   ...Soon, the US will be in the business of
                   recovering plutonium from our own surplus
                   weapons.<br />
                   ...Nuclear power plants (and reprocessing
                   plants) are costly to build, and they depend
                   on government subsidies and loan guarantees
                   to be competitive. Large reactors can cost
                   $2.5 billion to $4 billion each; it takes
                   decades to recoup the investment. As part
                   of the 2005 Energy Policy Act, Congress granted
                   approximately $10 billion in new subsidies
                   to the nuclear industry.<br />
                   Many environmentalists fear that public investment
                   in nuclear will gobble up dollars that could
                   be invested in renewable energy and energy
                   efficiency. The National Resources Defense
                   Council warns that the cost of nuclear power
                   is prohibitive and makes it uncompetitive
                   on the free market.<br />
                   ...Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute
                   has argued that, 
  "every dollar invested in nuclear expansion will worsen
  climate change by buying less solution per dollar."<br />
                   ...Many environmentalists are content to let
                   nuclear power fade into history because they
                   believe that the current paradigm of the energy
                   grid, featuring large, centralized power plants,
                   is outdated. The evolving model involves decentralized
                   generation, often called "the Internet
                   for energy."
                   ...Stewart Brand insists that a decentralized
                   model does not preclude nuclear power generation.
                   Indeed, a race is on worldwide to produce
                   a new generation of small nuclear reactors
                   that can live on a barge or sit in a hole
                   in the ground for decades. ....</span></p>

                   Hopes Water Will Power Its Ambitions.</a> By
                   DAVID L. STERN, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   NUREK, Tajikistan — The inscription
                   just above a tunnel at the foot of the colossal
                   Nurek hydropower dam in south central Tajikistan
                   is succinct: “Water Is Life.” The
                   frigid, frothing Vakhsh River rushing under
                   it adds a visual punctuation mark.<br />
                   In Tajikistan, the source of more than 40
                   percent of Central Asia’s water, this
                   is no mere platitude. The mountainous state
                   lacks the industry and natural riches that
                   bless other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
                   Water is one of the few resources the country
                   possesses in great abundance.<br />
                   For this reason, President Emomali Rakhmon
                   has pinned Tajikistan’s economic hopes — and
                   perhaps even its continued political existence — on
                   developing its hydropower potential.<br />
                   Three projects are either under construction
                   or being considered, including Rogun, a gargantuan
                   structure farther up the Vakhsh River. Tajik
                   officials say they have hopes of building
                   more than 20 hydroelectric plants and dams.<br />
                   But a number of sizable hurdles must be surmounted
                   before the plans for a great hydropower future
                   can be realized. Tajikistan is in an earthquake
                   zone and the dams must be built to withstand
                   major seismic shocks. Officials are expected
                   to conduct environmental impact studies to
                   determine whether any flora or fauna will
                   be threatened.<br />
                   The Tajik government is also heavily in debt
                   and must find heavy foreign investment to
                   build the dams. On Wednesday, China agreed
                   to build a $300 million hydroelectric power
                   plant, Nurobad-2, with a capacity of 160 to
                   220 megawatts. But Tajik officials say Rogun
                   alone will cost up to $3.2 billion.<br />
                   ...Though for the moment it seems to be managing,
                   Tajikistan threatens to become a failed state,
                   say Western experts and diplomats...The country
                   still has not fully recovered from a devastating
                   civil war a decade ago. State coffers are
                   virtually empty, while the government is viewed
                   as unable to meet basic needs.<br />
                   ...All of Tajikistan’s power troubles
                   will be remedied by the dam projects, the
                   Rakhmon government hopes. They will not only
                   provide for all of Tajikistan’s energy
                   needs but also allow the country to export
                   power to neighboring countries.<br />
                   ...Rogun, for example, will generate about
                   13 billion kilowatt hours per year, more than
                   80 percent of the country’s average
                   consumption, officials at the construction
                   site say....</span></p>

                   Storage Is Explored for Energy.</a> By KEN
                   BELSON, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg dreamed out
                   loud last week about a New York skyline filled
                   with wind turbines, one of the most serious
                   issues raised by the naysayers was that the
                   wind does not always blow when you need it.<br />
                   But a New Jersey company plans to announce
                   on Tuesday that it is working on a solution
                   to this perennial problem with wind power:
                   using wind turbines to produce compressed
                   air that can be stored underground or in tanks
                   and released later to power generators during
                   peak hours.<br />
                   The company, Public Service Enterprise Group
                   Global LLC, a subsidiary of P.S.E.G. Energy
                   Holdings, is forming a joint venture with
                   Michael Nakhamkin, a leader in the development
                   of energy storage technology....<br />
                   The venture has met with utilities that might
                   buy the storage technology. Compressed air
                   can be produced by a variety of fuels. But
                   the new venture hopes to put wind power generated
                   during off-peak hours to use during peak hours — typically
                   9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — and especially on
                   hot days.<br />
                   ...P.S.E.G. Global is trying to win a contract
                   to build 95 windmills that would produce a
                   maximum of 350 megawatts of electricity off
                   the New Jersey coast. If the company is chosen,
                   it would consider linking the windmills to
                   a compressed air storage plant, Mr. Byrd said,
                   and then feeding it into the power grid.<br />
                   Roy Daniel, the chief executive of Energy
                   Storage and Power, said that an underground
                   reservoir the size of Giants Stadium could
                   hold enough compressed air to power three
                   300-megawatt plants. (One megawatt hour can
                   power a large hospital for an hour.) The reservoirs,
                   which are typically more than 1,500 feet below
                   ground, could take eight hours to fill at
                   night. The compressed air would be released
                   to run generators for eight hours during the
                   day....</span></p>

                   Spill on Nearly 100 Miles of Mississippi River.</a> By
                   ADAM NOSSITER, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   NEW ORLEANS - A sheen of oil coated the Mississippi
                   River for nearly 100 miles from the center
                   of this city to the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday
                   following the worst oil spill here in nearly
                   a decade. The fuel-laden barge that collided
                   with a heavy tanker on Wednesday was still
                   leaking.<br />
                   The thick industrial fuel pouring from the
                   barge could be smelled for miles in city neighborhoods
                   up and down the river, even as hundreds of
                   cleanup workers struggled to contain the hundreds
                   of thousands of gallons. Some environmentalists
                   worried about reports of fish and bird kills
                   in sensitive marsh areas downstream, though
                   officials said they had so far heard of only
                   a handful of oil-covered birds. Booms to protect
                   areas richest in wildlife, at the river's
                   mouth, were being deployed, officials said.<br />
                   ..."We've had a number of large spills
                   in the New Orleans area, but this is a heavy,
                   nasty product, problematic in the cleanup," said
                   Lt. Cmdr. Cheri Ben-Iesau of the Coast Guard,
                   adding that it is of the sort normally used
                   to fire up boilers at power plants.<br />
  "It's a significant spill, if for nothing else because
  of its impact on the water supply," Commander Ben-Iesau
  said. "We've got a lot of commerce dependent on this water
  supply, so we're scrambling to get it cleaned up."<br />
                   ...Officials were generally guarded about
                   the possible effects on fish, plants and wildlife
                   in these rivers of grass and marshlands, but
                   some in the state's environmental community
                   were not.<br />
  "When it goes down to the area where there are no longer
  levees, it gets into the swamp," said Wilma Subra of the
  Louisiana Environmental Action Network. "It's going to
  contaminate the marsh."....</span></p>

                   In papers published over a quarter of a century
                   ago (1-3), we discussed the assets and liabilities
                   of isolating high-level radioactive wastes
                   (HLWs) (chiefly spent fuel from nuclear reactors)
                   from the environment by burying them in areas
                   with deep water tables, ... This idea--endorsed
                   for further study by our colleagues at the
                   U.S. Geological Survey and by scientists at
                   Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (4) and the U.S.
                   Nuclear Regulatory Commission (5)--eventually
                   led to identification of Yucca Mountain (YM)
                   (see photograph) as a potential repository
                   for HLWs. ....<br />
                   The idea of storing radioactive waste at YM
                   was born into political controversy. In 1987,
                   Congress, via an amendment to the Nuclear
                   Waste Policy Act of 1982, selected YM from
                   a group of three previously identified potential
                   repository sites. ...the Nuclear Waste Policy
                   Amendments Act of 1987 became known among
                   Nevadans as the "screw Nevada bill."<br />
                   ...The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
                   of Columbia Circuit was aware that some of
                   the radionuclides in HLWs have half-lives
                   of thousands to millions of years and followed
                   a recommendation of the National Research
                   Council (9) regarding time frames. ... for
                   permissible releases of radioactivity to the
                   environment to encompass a time frame of hundreds
                   of thousands to a million years. Before the
                   court's ruling, the USEPA considered a 10,000-year
                   time frame as an achievable requirement. ....<br />
                   ...Last, and hardly least, is the decades-old
                   public opposition to a geologic repository,
                   not only in Nevada and across the United States,
                   but in Europe as well.... This opposition
                   stems from various concerns and/or agendas,
                   including: fear of nuclear radiation; distrust
                   of governmental and technical community assurances
                   regarding safety; opposition to nuclear power;
                   and various NIMBY...-related issues....<br />
                   In view of the above matters, it has been
                   argued that HLWs should be stored at the surface,
                   perhaps even for a century or two during which
                   time better solutions may develop. However,
                   extended surface storage of the HLWs (presently
                   about 60,000 metric tons) at 72 commercial
                   reactor sites--many adjacent to metropolitan
                   areas and all next to rivers, lakes, or the
                   ocean--introduces its own set of uncertainties.
                   For example, what is the likelihood that more
                   pressing future national problems could cause
                   final isolation of the HLWs to be postponed
                   indefinitely? What is the probability that
                   the funds for HLW disposal, now being generated
                   by a surcharge on nuclear-generated electricity,
                   will still be available a century in the future?
                   In the event of accidents, sabotage, or a
                   loss of institutional control, a variety of
                   scenarios can be envisioned that would create
                   environmental hazards greater than any that
                   could result from emplacement of HLWs in an
                   underground repository. ....<br />
                   Given that both geologic isolation of HLWs
                   and their storage at the surface are fraught
                   with uncertainty, how might we proceed with
                   the disposition of HLWs in a manner that restores
                   public confidence?</span></p>

                   WASHINGTON -- Efforts to harness the energy
                   potential of Earth's ocean winds could soon
                   gain an important new tool: global satellite
                   maps from NASA. Scientists have been creating
                   maps using nearly a decade of data from NASA's
                   QuikSCAT satellite that reveal ocean areas
                   where winds could produce wind energy.<br />
                   The new maps have many potential uses including
                   planning the location of offshore wind farms
                   to convert wind energy into electric energy...<br />
  "Wind energy is environmentally friendly. After the initial
  energy investment to build and install wind turbines, you don't
  burn fossil fuels that emit carbon," said study lead author
  Tim Liu, a senior research scientist and QuikSCAT science team
  leader at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. "Like
  solar power, wind energy is green energy."<br />
                   QuikSCAT, launched in 1999, tracks the speed,
                   direction and power of winds near the ocean
                   surface. Data from QuikSCAT, collected continuously
                   by a specialized microwave radar instrument
                   named SeaWinds, also are used to predict storms

                   to 15 percent of future world energy requirements,
                   according to Paul Dimotakis, chief technologist
                   at JPL. If ocean areas with high winds were
                   tapped for wind energy, they could potentially
                   generate 500 to 800 watts of energy per square
                   meter, according to Liu's research. Dimotakis
                   notes that while this is slightly less than
                   solar energy (which generates about one kilowatt
                   of energy per square meter), wind power can
                   be converted to electricity more efficiently
                   than solar energy and at a lower cost per
                   watt of electricity produced.</span>..</p>

                   urged to proceed more deliberately with global
                   plan to expand nuclear power.</a> David Kramer,
                   Physics Today page 19. <span>Excerpt:
                   Critics of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership
                   [GNEP] say the Department of Energy is rushing
                   to commercialize unproven technologies. ...Many
                   experts believe that a vast expansion of nuclear
                   power is the only plausible option for meeting
                   the anticipated explosion in electricity demand
                   from the developing world while mitigating
                   global warming.<br />
                   ...Unveiled in 2006 by President Bush, the
                   GNEP envisions the US and other nuclear powers
                   supplying aspiring nuclear nations with both
                   advanced reactors and the nuclear fuel for
                   them. For their part, recipient nations would
                   agree to return their spent fuel to its nation
                   of origin and pledge not to develop uranium-enrichment
                   or spent-fuel reprocessing capabilities of
                   their own.<br />
                   ...Two groups of outside reviewers also have
                   urged DOE to apply the brakes to the GNEP.
                   The Government Accountability Office warned
                   in a May report that moving to construction
                   too rapidly will "likely require using
                   unproven evolutions of existing technologies" and
                   ultimately limit their usefulness for nuclear
                   waste reduction and proliferation prevention.<br />
                   ...No feature of the GNEP is more controversial
                   than reprocessing, a technology that the US
                   forswore for civilian use in the late 1970s
                   out of concern that reprocessed plutonium
                   could be stolen or diverted for weapons purposes.<br />
                   ... "We know exactly what it costs to
                   reprocess, but nobody has even the slightest
                   idea what it will cost to store spent fuel," [Alan]
                   Hanson [executive vice president of Areva,
                   the French nuclear conglomerate] told the
                   May roundtable.<br />
                   Indeed, storage costs can't be estimated as
                   long as the already decades-long delay with
                   building the Yucca Mountain site drags on.
                   But even if the repository is completed-not
                   before 2020, according to DOE-it will have
                   only enough room for spent fuel that is generated
                   through the year 2010 (see PHYSICS TODAY,
                   June 2008, page 28). Without reprocessing,
                   DOE warns, a second repository will need to
                   be built to accommodate the growing quantities
                   of spent fuel that will result from a revitalized
                   US nuclear industry, let alone material that
                   will be shipped back to the US under the GNEP.</span></p>

                   Energy Future: Why Water Matters.</a> David
                   Holtz, Clean Water Action News. <span>Excerpt:
                   While enacting strong policies that encourage
                   energy sources like wind and solar seem like
                   obvious good global warming and employment
                   solutions, it is also increasingly clear that
                   water - protecting it, conserving it - matters
                   a lot in considering other choices, particularly
                   nuclear and coal, in the context of global
                   warming.<br />
                   ... Proposed expansion of nuclear power and
                   the introduction of new, untried technology
                   of capturing carbon from coal plant emissions
                   and sequestering it underground raise important
                   and still unaddressed questions related to
                   water. Both nuclear and coal power plants
                   use huge amounts of water, mostly in cooling
                   processes.<br />
                   ... In August, the Tennessee Valley Authority
                   was forced to shut down one reactor at the
                   Browns Ferry nuclear plant in Alabama and
                   scale back production at the plant's two other
                   reactors because of overheated water in the
                   Tennessee River, which is used to cool the
                   facility.<br />
                   ..."Water is the nuclear industry's Achilles
                   heel," Jim Warren, executive director
                   of N.C. Waste Awareness and Reduction Network,
                   told the Associated Press in January. "You
                   need a lot of water to operate nuclear plants."<br />
                   The vast amounts of water used by coal plants
                   for cooling purposes also raise questions,
                   said Roger Smith, Clean Water Action's Global
                   Warming and Energy Policy Associate. "All
                   of our assumptions for power plant water use
                   are based on current and historical levels
                   of water," Smith explained. "What

                   Judge Cites Carbon Dioxide in Denying Coal
                   Plant Permit.</a> By Matthew L. Wald, The
                   New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   A judge in Georgia has thrown out an air pollution
                   permit for a new coal-fired power plant because
                   the permit did not set limits on carbon dioxide
                   emissions.<br />
                   Both opponents of coal use and the company
                   that wants to build the plant said it was
                   the first time a court decision had linked
                   carbon dioxide to an air pollution permit.<br />
                   The decision’s broader legal impact
                   was not clear, either for the plant, proposed
                   to be built near Blakely, in Early County,
                   Ga., or for others outside Georgia, but it
                   signaled that builders of coal plants would
                   face continued difficulties in the court system
                   as well as with elected officials in many
                   states.<br />
                   In the ruling released late Monday afternoon,
                   a state judge relied on a decision by the
                   Supreme Court last year that carbon dioxide
                   could be regulated as a pollutant. Carbon
                   dioxide, which is colorless, odorless and
                   not directly harmful to animals or plants,
                   is not now regulated, and the Bush administration
                   has signaled that it would not issue such
                   regulations before the president leaves office.<br />
                   But the judge, Thelma Wyatt Cummings Moore
                   in Superior Court in Fulton County, Ga., said
                   that federal air pollution control laws required
                   pollution permits to cover all pollutants
                   that could be regulated under the Clean Air
                   Act, not just those for which there is “a
                   separate, general numerical limitation.”<br />
                   Robert Wyman, a partner in the Los Angeles
                   office of Latham &amp; Watkins, the law firm,
                   who has represented power producers in previous
                   cases, said of the decision: “I would
                   be surprised if it had much of an impact.
                   I’m not sure other jurisdictions will
                   pick up that opinion.”<br />
                   Vickie Patton, the deputy general counsel
                   at the Environmental Defense Fund, however,
                   argued that the judge’s reasoning might
                   prove persuasive to other courts facing similar

                   WASHINGTON - For years, scientists have had
                   a straightforward idea for taming global warming.
                   They want to take the carbon dioxide that
                   spews from coal-burning power plants and pump
                   it back into the ground. President Bush ...
                   has spent years talking up the virtues of "clean
                   coal." All three candidates to succeed
                   him favor the approach. So do many other members
                   of Congress.<br />
                   Coal companies are for it. Many environmentalists
                   favor it. Utility executives are practically
                   begging for the technology. But it has become
                   clear in recent months that the nation's effort
                   to develop the technique is lagging badly.
                   In January, the government canceled its support
                   for what was supposed to be a showcase project,
                   a plant at a carefully chosen site in Illinois
                   where there was coal, access to the power
                   grid, and soil underfoot that backers said
                   could hold the carbon dioxide for eons.<br />
                   Perhaps worse, in the last few months, utility
                   projects in Florida, West Virginia, Ohio,
                   Minnesota and Washington State that would
                   have made it easier to capture carbon dioxide
                   have all been canceled or thrown into regulatory
                   limbo.<br />
                   ...In Wisconsin, engineers are testing a method
                   that may allow them to bolt machinery for
                   capturing carbon dioxide onto the back of
                   old-style power plants; Sweden, Australia
                   and Denmark are planning similar tests. And
                   German engineers are exploring another approach,
                   one that involves burning coal in pure oxygen,
                   which would produce a clean stream of exhaust
                   gases that could be injected into the ground.
                   But no project is very far along, and it remains
                   an open question whether techniques for capturing
                   and storing carbon dioxide will be available
                   by the time they are critically needed....</span></p>

                   Plans to Resume Building Atomic Plants.</a>By
                   ELISABETH ROSENTHAL, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   ROME - Italy announced Thursday that within
                   five years it planned to resume building nuclear
                   energy plants, two decades after a public
                   referendum resoundingly banned nuclear power
                   and deactivated all its reactors. ...The change
                   is a striking sign of the times, reflecting
                   growing concern in many European countries
                   over the skyrocketing price of oil and energy
                   security, and the warming effects of carbon
                   emissions from fossil fuels. All have combined
                   to make this once-scorned form of energy far
                   more palatable.<br />
  "Italy has had the most dramatic, the most public turnaround,
  but the sentiments against nuclear are reversing very quickly
  all across Europe - Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Germany and more," said
  Ian Hore-Lacey, spokesman for the World Nuclear Association,
  an industry group based in London.<br />
                   ...A number of European countries have banned
                   or restricted nuclear power in the past 20
                   years, including Italy, which closed all its
                   plants. Germany and Belgium have long prohibited
                   the building of reactors, although existing
                   ones were allowed to run their natural lifespan.
                   France was one of the few countries that continued
                   to rely heavily on nuclear power.<br />
                   ...conditions were very different in the 1980s,
                   when European countries turned away from nuclear
                   power. Oil cost less than $50 a barrel, global
                   warming was a fringe science and climate change
                   had not been linked to manmade emissions.
                   Perhaps more important for the public psyche,
                   almost all of Europe's nuclear bans and restrictions
                   were enacted after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster
                   in the Soviet Union in which radioactivity
                   was released into the environment.<br />
                   The equation has changed. Today, with oil
                   approaching $150 a barrel, most European countries,
                   which generally have no oil and gas resources,
                   have been forced by finances to consider new
                   forms of energy - and fast. New nuclear plants
                   take 20 years to build. Also, Europeans watched
                   in horror in 2006 as President Vladimir V.
                   Putin of Russia cut off the natural gas supply
                   to Ukraine in a price dispute, leaving it
                   in darkness.<br />
                   ...To build nuclear plants, Italy would almost
                   certainly have to improve its system of dealing
                   with nuclear waste. The plants that were shut
                   down years ago still store 235 tons of nuclear
                   fuel. See also World Uranium Reserves, [http://www.americanenergyindependence.com/uranium.html]

                   Turns Back to Coal, Raising Climate Fears</a>.
                   ELISABETH ROSENTHAL. The NY times. <span>Excerpt:
                   At a time when the world’s top climate
                   experts agree that carbon emissions must be
                   rapidly reduced to hold down global warming,
                   Italy’s major electricity producer,
                   Enel, is converting its massive power plant
                   here from oil to coal, generally the dirtiest
                   fuel on earth. Over the next five years, Italy
                   will increase its reliance on coal to 33 percent
                   from 14 percent. Power generated by Enel from
                   coal will rise to 50 percent. And Italy is
                   not alone in its return to coal. Driven by
                   rising demand, record high oil and natural
                   gas prices, concerns over energy security
                   and an aversion to nuclear energy, European
                   countries are expected to put into operation
                   about 50 coal-fired plants over the next five
                   years, plants that will be in use for the
                   next five decades… <br />
                   Enel and many other electricity companies
                   say they have little choice but to build coal
                   plants to replace aging infrastructure, particularly
                   in countries like Italy and Germany that have
                   banned the building of nuclear power plants.
                   Fuel costs have risen 151 percent since 1996,
                   and Italians pay the highest electricity costs
                   in Europe. In terms of cost and energy security,
                   coal has all the advantages, its proponents
                   argue. Coal reserves will last for 200 years,
                   rather than 50 years for gas and oil. Coal
                   is relatively cheap compared with oil and
                   natural gas, although coal prices have tripled
                   in the past few years. More important, hundreds
                   of countries export coal — there is
                   not a coal cartel — so there is more
                   room to negotiate prices…<br />
                   The task — in which carbon emissions
                   are pumped into underground reservoirs rather
                   than released — is challenging for any
                   fuel source, but particularly so for coal,
                   which produces more carbon dioxide than oil
                   or natural gas. Under optimal current conditions,
                   coal produces more than twice as much carbon
                   dioxide per unit of electricity as natural
                   gas, the second most common fuel used for
                   electricity generation, according to the Electric
                   Power Research Institute. In the developing
                   world, where even new coal plants use lower
                   grade coal and less efficient machinery, the
                   equation is even worse…The European
                   Union had pledged to develop 12 pilot carbon-capture
                   projects for Europe, but says that is not
                   enough.<br />
                   On many other fronts, the new Enel plant is
                   a model of efficiency and recycling. The nitrous
                   oxide is chemically altered to generate ammonia,
                   which is then sold. The resulting coal ash
                   and gypsum are sold to the cement industry.<br />
                   An on-site desalination plant means that the
                   operation generates its own water for cooling.
                   Even the heated water that comes out of the
                   plant is not wasted: it heats a fish farm,
                   one of Italy’s largest…<br />
                   In the towns surrounding Civitavecchia, the
                   impending arrival of a huge coal plant, with
                   its three silvery domes, is being greeted
                   with a hefty dose of dread….</span></p>

                   Smooths the Way for Home Wind-Power Turbines</a>.
                   By JOHN CASEY, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   Wind turbines, once used primarily for farms
                   and rural houses far from electrical service,
                   are becoming more common in heavily populated
                   residential areas as homeowners are attracted
                   to ease of use, financial incentives and low
                   environmental effects.<br />
                   No one tracks the number of small-scale residential
                   wind turbines - windmills that run turbines
                   to produce electricity - in the United States.
                   ... a convergence of factors, political, technical
                   and ecological, has caused a surge in the
                   use of residential wind turbines, especially
                   in the Northeast and California. "Back
                   in the early days, off-grid electrical generation
                   was pursued mostly by hippies and rednecks,
                   usually in isolated, rural areas," said
                   Joe Schwartz, editor of Home Power magazine. "Now,
                   it's a lot more mainstream."<br />
  "The big shift happened in the last three years," Mr.
  Schwartz said, because of technology that makes it possible
  to feed electricity back to the grid, the commercial power
  system fed by large utilities. "These new systems use
  the utility for back up power, removing the need for big, expensive
  battery backup systems." ...Ecological concerns, more
  than cost savings may drive many new residential turbine installations. "People
  want to reduce their carbon footprints," Mr. Tonko said. "They're
  concerned about climate change and they want to reduce our
  reliance of foreign sources of fuels."<br />
                   Mr. Schwartz, the editor, said that even with
                   the economic benefits, it can take 20 years
                   to pay back the installation cost. "This
                   isn't about people putting turbines in to
                   lower their electric bills as much as it is
                   about people voting with their dollars to
                   help the environment in some small way," he
                   said.<br />
                   ...Even if the wind is strong, zoning and
                   aesthetics can pose problems. "Turbines
                   work in rural areas with strong wind," Mr.
                   Schwartz said. "But in urban and suburban
                   areas, neighbors are never happy to see a
                   60- to 120-foot tower going up across the
                   street."</span></p>

                   Ways to Store Solar Energy for Nighttime and
                   Cloudy Days</a>. By MATTHEW L. WALD, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   Solar power, the holy grail of renewable energy,
                   has always faced the problem of how to store
                   the energy captured from the sun's rays so
                   that demand for electricity can be met at
                   night or whenever the sun is not shining.
                   The difficulty is that electricity is hard
                   to store. Batteries are not up to efficiently
                   storing energy on a large scale. A different
                   approach being tried by the solar power industry
                   could eliminate the problem.<br />
                   The idea is to capture the sun's heat. ...
                   a "power tower," a little bit like
                   a water tank on stilts surrounded by hundreds
                   of mirrors that tilt on two axes, one to follow
                   the sun across the sky in the course of the
                   day and the other in the course of the year.
                   In the tower and in a tank below are tens
                   of thousands of gallons of molten salt that
                   can be heated to very high temperatures and
                   not reach high pressure.<br />
                   ...Terry Murphy, president and chief executive
                   of SolarReserve, ... design is for a power
                   tower that can supply 540 megawatts of heat.
                   At the high temperatures it could achieve,
                   that would produce 250 megawatts of electricity,
                   enough to run a fair-size city. It might make
                   more sense to produce a smaller quantity and
                   run well into the evening or around the clock
                   or for several days when it is cloudy, he
                   said.<br />
                   At Black &amp; Veatch, a builder of power
                   plants, Larry Stoddard, the manager of renewable
                   energy consulting, said that with a molten
                   salt design, "your turbine is totally
                   buffered from the vagaries of the sun." By
                   contrast, "if I've got a 50 megawatt
                   photovoltaic plant, covering 300 acres or
                   so, and a large cloud comes over, I lose 50
                   megawatts in something like 100 to 120 seconds," he
                   said, adding, "That strikes fear into
                   the hearts of utility dispatchers."....</span></p>

                   Block Solar Panels, and a Feud Ends in Court</a>.
                   By FELICITY BARRINGER, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   Under a California law, a criminal court ruled
                   that these redwood trees cast too much shade
                   on Mark Vargas's solar panels. SUNNYVALE,
                   Calif. - Call it an eco-parable: one Prius-driving
                   couple takes pride in their eight redwoods,...
                   Their electric-car-driving neighbors take
                   pride in their rooftop solar panels, installed
                   five years after the first trees were planted.<br />
                   ...The solar-redwoods dispute is unusual largely
                   because it is a solar-panel owner who is mounting
                   the challenge. Typically, solar-panel owners
                   have to play defense. For example, despite
                   a 1980 Arizona law to protect homeowners who
                   install photovoltaic panels, Henry Speak,
                   a retiree in Avondale, Ariz., had to battle
                   his homeowners' association through a series
                   of state courts to keep his rooftop solar
                   system without adding expensive screening
                   - screening that, like the redwoods, would
                   have reduced the panels' efficiency.<br />
                   ...On both sides of the Sunnyvale backyard
                   fence, there is evidence of environmental
                   virtue - one Prius (Ms. Bissett and Mr. Treanor),
                   one electric car (the Vargases), one water-free
                   xeriscaped front yard with recycled-plastic
                   borders (Ms. Bissett and Mr. Treanor), 128
                   solar panels providing almost all the power
                   for one home (the Vargases), and eight carbon-dioxide-sipping,
                   bird-friendly redwood trees in various stages
                   of growth (Ms. Bissett and Mr. Treanor). ...There
                   was little communication between the neighbors
                   - until Ms. Bissett introduced three redwood
                   trees in 1996. In the next five years, she
                   planted five more....<br />
                   In 2001, Mr. Vargas installed solar panels
                   ... then informed his neighbors - brusquely,
                   they say - about the solar shade law, saying
                   they must cut down all of the redwoods. ...
                   and offered to pay for removal and replacement.<br />
                   ... in 2005, the deputy district attorney,
                   John Fioretta, began the first prosecution
                   under the Solar Shade Act. It ended in December
                   with the conviction of Ms. Bissett and Mr.
                   Treanor by Judge Kurt Kumli of Santa Clara
                   County Superior Court. ...found that Trees
                   Nos. 4, 5 and 6, ... were now collectively
                   blocking more than 10 percent of the panels
                   over the hot tub. Trees Nos. 1, 2 and 3 shaded
                   the area when the panels were installed, so
                   they were exempt, and Trees Nos. 7 and 8 did
                   not violate the law, the judge ruled. ...Mr.
                   Treanor and Ms. Bissett still do not quite
                   believe what happened. "It was like I'd
                   been hit in the chest," Ms. Bissett said
                   ....<br />
                   Mr. Vargas said it all could have been avoided. "My
                   entire goal was to find a more appropriate
                   tree to place between our two properties," he
                   said. "To have a 60-foot barrier is unreasonable."....</span></p>

                   BOULDER CITY, Nev. - At first, as he adjusted
                   pumps and checked temperatures, Aaron Boucher
                   looked like any technician in the control
                   room of an electrical plant. Then he rushed
                   to the window and scanned the sky, to check
                   his fuel supply. ...Especially in areas of
                   intense sun, an array of reflectors can concentrate
                   sunlight, heating a fluid to create steam
                   and power. Mr. Boucher was battling clouds,
                   timing the operations of his power plant to
                   get the most out of patchy sunshine. It is
                   a skill that may soon be in greater demand,
                   for the world appears to be on the verge of
                   a boom in a little-known but promising type
                   of solar power ... covering acres of desert
                   with mirrors that focus intense sunlight on
                   a fluid, heating it enough to make steam.
                   The steam turns a turbine and generates electricity.
                   ...After a decade of no activity, two prototype
                   solar thermal plants were recently opened
                   in the United States, with a capacity that
                   could power several big hotels, neon included,
                   on the Las Vegas Strip, about 20 miles north
                   of here. Another 10 power plants are in advanced
                   planning in California, Arizona and Nevada.<br />
                   On sunny afternoons, those 10 plants would
                   produce as much electricity as three nuclear
                   reactors, but they can be built in as little
                   as two years, compared with a decade or longer
                   for a nuclear plant. Some of the new plants
                   will feature systems that allow them to store
                   heat and generate electricity for hours after
                   sunset. Aside from the ones in the United
                   States, eight plants are under construction
                   in Spain, Algeria and Morocco. Another nine
                   projects are in various stages of planning
                   in those countries as well as Israel, Mexico,
                   China, South Africa and Egypt, ...Donald E.
                   Brandt, the chief executive of Pinnacle West,
                   said the decision to build the new solar plant
                   was as important as his company's decision
                   in 1973 to build the Palo Verde nuclear plant,
                   the largest and most modern in the United
                   States.<br />
  "The key is, the solar technology has advanced," Mr.
  Brandt said. At 280 megawatts, "it's a critical size;
  it's a real power plant; it's meaningful; it's beyond the demonstration
  stage."<br />
                   ...If large numbers of plants are built, they
                   will eventually pose some problems, even in
                   the desert. They could take up immense amounts
                   of land and damage the environment. Already,
                   building a plant in California requires hiring
                   a licensed tortoise wrangler to capture and
                   relocate endangered desert tortoises. "The
                   one thing that's eventually going to raise
                   its head is desert biodiversity, and the land
                   area itself," said Terrence J. Collins,

                   Mellon University....</span></p>

  "That's just money you're hearing," he said as they
  hummed in a brisk breeze recently.<br />
                   Texas, once the oil capital of North America,
                   is rapidly turning into the capital of wind
                   power. ...more than 3 percent of its electricity,
                   enough to supply power to one million homes,
                   comes from wind turbines. Texans are even

                   the best oil field I ever found." He
                   is planning to build the biggest wind farm
                   in the world, a $10 billion behemoth that
                   could power a small city by itself. <br />
                   Wind turbines were once a marginal form of
                   electrical generation. But amid rising concern
                   about greenhouse gases from coal-burning power
                   plants, wind power is booming. Installed wind
                   capacity in the United States grew 45 percent
                   last year, albeit from a small base, and a
                   comparable increase is expected this year. <br />
                   ...The United States recently overtook Spain
                   as the world's second-largest wind power market,
                   after Germany, with $9 billion invested last
                   year. <br />
                   ...The turbines are getting bigger and their
                   blades can kill birds and bats. Aesthetic
                   and wildlife issues have led to opposition
                   emerging around the country, particularly
                   in coastal areas like Cape Cod. Some opposition
                   in Texas has cropped up as well, ...Some Texans
                   see the sleek new turbines as a welcome change
                   in the landscape. "Texas has been looking
                   at oil and gas rigs for 100 years, and frankly,
                   wind turbines look a little nicer," said
                   Jerry Patterson, the Texas land commissioner.... <br />
                   ...At the end of 2007, Texas ranked No. 1
                   in the nation with installed wind power of
                   4,356 megawatts (and 1,238 under construction),
                   far outdistancing California's 2,439 megawatts
                   (and 165 under construction). Minnesota and
                   Iowa came in third and fourth with almost
                   1,300 megawatts each (and 46 and 116 under
                   construction, respectively). <br />
                   Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado and Oregon, states
                   with smaller populations than Texas, all get
                   5 to 8 percent of their power from wind farms,
                   according to estimates by the American Wind
                   Energy Association....</span></p>

                   'Bold' Step to Capture an Elusive Gas Falters.</a> By
                   ANDREW C. REVKIN, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   CAPTURING heat-trapping emissions from coal-fired
                   power plants is on nearly every climate expert's
                   menu for a planet whose inhabitants all want
                   a plugged-in lifestyle.<br />
                   So there was much enthusiasm five years ago
                   when the Bush administration said it would
                   pursue "one of the boldest steps our
                   nation has taken toward a pollution-free energy
                   future" by building a commercial-scale
                   coal-fire plant that would emit no carbon
                   dioxide - the greenhouse gas that makes those
                   plants major contributors to global warming.<br />
                   That bold step forward stumbled last week.
                   With the budget of the so-called FutureGen
                   project having nearly doubled, to $1.8 billion,
                   and the government responsible for more than
                   70 percent of the eventual bill, the administration
                   completely revamped the project. ...The idea
                   is to capture carbon dioxide emitted by coal-fire
                   power plants and then pump it deep into the
                   earth to avoid further buildup of the gas
                   in the atmosphere. But several experts said
                   the plan still lacked the scope to test various
                   gas-separation technologies, coal varieties,
                   and - most important - whether varied geological
                   conditions can permanently hold carbon dioxide.<br />
                   Coal companies are desperate for this option
                   to work, given how much coal remains to be
                   mined. Many climate scientists and environmental
                   campaigners see it as vital. Steady growth
                   in coal use by developing and industrialized
                   countries is expected to extend well beyond
                   2030. David G. Hawkins, an energy analyst
                   at the Natural Resources Defense Council,
                   said the new approach would have been a good
                   move four years ago. "But to tout FutureGen
                   for five years and then in the president's
                   last year pull the plug is just bait and switch," he

                   Energy.</a> Research News, Lawrence Berkeley
                   National Laboratory. <span>Excerpt:
                   BERKELEY, CA -- ... geochemists Mack Kennedy
                   of the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley
                   National Laboratory and Matthijs van Soest
                   of Arizona State University have discovered
                   a new tool for identifying potential geothermal
                   energy resources.<br />
Currently, most developed geothermal energy comes from regions
of volcanic activity, such as The Geysers in Northern California.
The potential resources identified by Kennedy and van Soest arise
not from volcanism but from the flow of surface fluids through
deep fractures that penetrate the earth's lower crust, in regions
far from current or recent volcanic activity. The researchers
report their findings in the November 30, 2007 issue of Science.<br />
"A good geothermal energy source has three basic requirements:
a high thermal gradient -- which means accessible hot rock --
plus a rechargeable reservoir fluid, usually water, and finally,
deep permeable pathways for the fluid to circulate through the
hot rock," says Kennedy, a staff scientist in Berkeley Lab's
Earth Sciences Division. "We believe we have found a way
to map and quantify zones of permeability deep in the lower crust
that result not from volcanic activity but from tectonic activity,
the movement of pieces of the Earth's crust."<br />
Kennedy and van Soest made their discovery by comparing the ratios
of helium isotopes in samples gathered from wells, surface springs,
and vents across the northern Basin and Range. ...a high ratio
of helium-three to helium-four in a fluid sample indicates that
much of the fluid came from the mantle.<br />
..."We have never seen such a clear correlation of surface
geochemical signals with tectonic activity, nor have we ever
been able to quantify deep permeability from surface measurements
of any kind," says Kennedy. The samples they collected on
the surface gave the researchers a window into the structure
of the rocks far below, with no need to drill.<br />
With the urgent need to find energy sources that are renewable
and don't emit greenhouse gases, geothermal energy is ideal -- "the
best renewable energy source besides the sun," Kennedy says.
Accessible geothermal energy in the United States, excluding
Alaska and Hawaii, has been estimated at 9 x 1016 (90 quadrillion)
kilowatt-hours, 3,000 times more than the country's total annual
energy consumption....</span></p>

                   Turns to a Promising Power Source, With Flaws. </a>The
                   New York Times. By MARK LANDLER. <span>Excerpt:<br />
                   MALMO, Sweden ...A 30-mile-an-hour wind was
                   twirling the fingerlike blades of a turbine
                   380 feet above his head. Around him, a field
                   of turbines rotated in a synchronized ballet
                   that, when fully connected to an electrical
                   grid, would generate enough power to light
                   60,000 nearby houses.<br />
  "We've created a new landmark," said Mr. [Arne] Floderus,
  the project manager of the $280 million wind park, one of the
  world's largest, which was built by the Swedish power company
  Vattenfall.<br />
                   ...Yet Sweden's gleaming wind park is entering
                   service at a time when wind energy is coming
                   under sharper scrutiny, not just from hostile
                   neighbors, who complain that the towers are
                   a blot on the landscape, but from energy experts
                   who question its reliability as a source of
                   power.<br />
                   For starters, the wind does not blow all the
                   time. When it does, it does not necessarily
                   do so during periods of high demand for electricity.
                   That makes wind a shaky replacement for more
                   dependable, if polluting, energy sources like
                   oil, coal and natural gas. Moreover, to capture
                   the best breezes, wind farms are often built
                   far from where the demand for electricity
                   is highest. The power they generate must then
                   be carried over long distances on high-voltage
                   lines, which in Germany and other countries
                   are strained and prone to breakdowns.<br />
                   ...In Denmark, which pioneered wind energy
                   in Europe, construction of wind farms has
                   stagnated in recent years. The Danes export
                   much of their wind-generated electricity to
                   Norway and Sweden because it comes in unpredictable
                   surges that often outstrip demand.<br />
                   ...For a socially conscious society like Sweden,
                   wind turbines exert a fashionable appeal.<br />
                   Today, they account for less than 1 percent
                   of Sweden's electricity generation. But the
                   government wants to increase annual wind power
                   production to 10 terawatt hours, or 10 trillion
                   watt hours, by 2015 from less than 1 terawatt
                   hour now (the park off Malmo will produce
                   a third of a terawatt hour).<br />
                   Vattenfall hopes to develop an even larger
                   off-shore park in the Baltic Sea, between
                   Sweden and Germany.<br />
                   ...Sweden does not need to build wind parks
                   to get wind power. It could simply buy more
                   surplus wind power from Denmark, which it
                   uses, as does Norway, to pump underground
                   water into elevated reservoirs. The water
                   is later released during periods of peak electric
                   demand to drive hydroelectric stations. In
                   this way, hydro acts as a form of storage
                   for wind energy - addressing one of wind power's
                   biggest shortcomings....</span></p>

                   climate change, an international panel of
                   scientists reported Monday.Governments and
                   the private sector are spending too little
                   on research into a partial solution - technology
                   to capture and store the carbon dioxide emissions
                   from such plants, the group said.<br />
                   The study by 15 scientists from 13 nations, "Lighting

                   commissioned by the governments of China and
                   Brazil and is the product of two years of
                   workshops organized by the InterAcademy Council,
                   the Netherlands-based network of national
                   academies of science.<br />
                   The 174-page report details current and developing
                   technologies, and government incentives and
                   other policies that could lead both the developed
                   and developing world to clean, affordable
                   and sustainable energy supplies.<br />

                   ... Japan sees nuclear power as a solution
                   to global warming, but.... Last week, a magnitude
                   6.8 earthquake caused dozens of problems at
                   the world's biggest nuclear plant, leading
                   to releases of radioactive elements into the
                   air and ocean and an indefinite shutdown.
                   ...Japan has a sordid history of serious nuclear
                   accidents or spills followed by cover-ups....
                   The U.S. government allows nuclear plants
                   to operate under a level of secrecy usually
                   reserved for the national security apparatus.
                   Last year...about nine gallons of highly enriched
                   uranium spilled at a processing plant in Tennessee,
                   forming a puddle a few feet from an elevator
                   shaft. Had it dripped into the shaft, it might
                   have formed a critical mass sufficient for
                   a chain reaction, releasing enough radiation
                   to kill or burn workers nearby....<br />
                   No U.S. utility has ordered a new nuclear
                   plant since 1978....<br />
                   Many respected academics and environmentalists
                   argue that nuclear power must be part of any
                   solution to climate change because nuclear
                   power plants don't release greenhouse gases.
                   ...nuclear power is extremely risky. ...there
                   are cleaner, cheaper, faster alternatives
                   that come with none of the risks.<br />
                   ...The Union of Concerned Scientists cites
                   51 cases at 41 U.S. nuclear plants in which
                   reactors have been shut down for more than
                   a year.... Nuclear plants are also considered
                   attractive terrorist targets.... Weapons proliferation
                   is an even more serious concern.... It would
                   be more than a little hypocritical for the
                   U.S. to expand its own nuclear power capacity
                   while forbidding countries it doesn't like
                   from doing the same. ...No country in the
                   world has yet built a permanent underground
                   waste repository.... The existing 104 nuclear
                   plants in the U.S., which supply roughly 20%
                   of the nation's electricity, are old and nearing
                   the end of their useful lives. ... to replace
                   them would require building a new reactor
                   every four or five months for the next 40
                   years. ...The average nuclear plant is estimated
                   to cost about $4 billion. Because of the risks
                   involved, there is scarce interest among investors
                   in putting up the needed capital. ...The newest
                   nuclear plant in the U.S. opened in 1996,
                   after having been ordered in 1970 - a 26-year

                   disposal, safe operation and security remain
                   major concerns, but economics may be the biggest

                   Turkey Waste, a New Fuel and a New Fight</a>.
                   By SUSAN SAULNY, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   BENSON, Minn. - ...Thanks to the abundance
                   of local droppings, Benson is home to a new
                   $200 million power plant that burns turkey
                   litter to produce electricity. For the last
                   few weeks now, since before generating operations
                   began in mid-May, turkey waste has poured
                   in from nearby farms by the truckload, filling
                   a fuel hall several stories high.<br />
                   The power plant is a novelty on the prairie,
                   the first in the country to burn animal litter
                   (manure mixed with farm-animal bedding like
                   wood chips). And it sits at the intersection
                   of two national obsessions: an appetite for
                   lean meat and a demand for alternative fuels.<br />
                   ...The critics say turkey litter, of all farm
                   animals' manure, is the most valuable just
                   as it is, useful as a rich, organic fertilizer
                   at a time when demand is growing for all things
                   organic. ...the unwanted attention shows,
                   once again, how the landscape of renewable
                   energy production is fraught with potential
                   land mines, even in a case that seems small-scale
                   and straightforward. What could be so offensive
                   about burning turkey poop?<br />
  "This is the only advancement in manure utilization since
  the manure spreader - that's 100-year-old technology," said
  Greg Langmo, a third-generation turkey farmer who lobbied for
  the plant, where he now works as a field manager.<br />
                   Minnesota produces more turkeys than any other
                   state, some 44.5 million birds in 2005, the
                   most recent year for which data are available.
                   It follows that the turkeys leave behind a
                   lot of waste in their pens, where most are
                   confined to gobble and peck until they are
                   robust enough for slaughter. The Benson plant,
                   then, has been of considerable help for farmers
                   with a disposal problem.<br />
                   The plant was built by Fibrowatt, a Philadelphia-based
                   company, with financial incentives from the
                   State of Minnesota.<br />
                   ...biomass burning, as it is called, produces
                   its own pollutants. According to information
                   in one of its federal air permits, the plant
                   is a major source of particulate matter, sulfur
                   dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides
                   and hydrogen sulfide....</span></p>

                   in Love with Wind</a>. OnEarth, NRDC. by Joseph
                   D'Agnese. <span>Excerpt:
                   How a small farm town traded its dairy cows
                   for renewable energy. In the spring of 1999
                   a stranger named Bill Moore arrived in the
                   small town of Lowville, ... New York, and
                   ... had what he considered a good proposal
                   for the 27,000 citizens of Lewis County: Milk
                   wind, not cows. When he started telling the
                   locals about his notion, Moore was met with
                   indulgent smiles but little genuine enthusiasm. "...they
                   looked at me like I was from Mars," he
                   says. "They were polite. They didn't
                   openly laugh."<br />
                   ...Eight years later, though, it's as if the
                   cool reception Moore received never happened
                   at all. Windmills stud the flat, stark landscape
                   as far as the eye can see. Each turbine is
                   taller than the Statue of Liberty, and nearly
                   all of them are spinning inexorably toward
                   the future of Lewis County -- and perhaps
                   our own. This is the Maple Ridge Wind Farm,
                   the nation's largest new alternative energy
                   project east of the Mississippi River. In
                   the last year or so, 195 turbines have become
                   operational in the towns of Lowville, Harrisburg,
                   and Martinsburg, capable of producing 320
                   megawatts of electricity, the amount generated
                   by a medium-size power plant, or enough power
                   to run 98,000 homes.<br />
                   ...The guaranteed income -- a minimum annual
                   payment of about $6,000 per turbine, adjusted
                   annually for inflation -- has transformed
                   their lives. "It's paying for me to retire," says
                   Bill Burke. "It's given us a chance to
                   stay in our house," adds Patricia Burke. "We
                   don't have to sell after all. We sold off
                   the herd one spring, and the heifers later,
                   ....<br />
                   ... Today, 20 percent of Denmark's electricity
                   comes from the wind. In sharp contrast to
                   Maple Ridge and other big U.S. wind farms,
                   of the 5,600 turbines in Denmark, only about
                   20 percent are owned by utility companies.
                   Twenty-three percent belong to cooperatives
                   and almost 60 percent to small, local companies
                   or to individuals, including farmers. This
                   has been the key to public acceptance. As
                   one Danish study concluded: "People who
                   own shares in a turbine are significantly
                   more positive about wind power than people
                   having no economic interest in the subject.
                   Members of wind cooperatives are more willing
                   to accept that their neighbor erect [sic]
                   a turbine." Other experts say that local
                   ownership makes wind power more economical,
                   since expenses are lower and companies more
                   competitive, with cheaper connection to the
                   grid than big utilities would offer and faster,
                   less bureaucratic decision-making. But now
                   that grassroots-owned technology has turned
                   into big business, not all is well in the
                   state of Denmark....</span></p>

                   Windfall Opens Choices for the Energy Dept</a>.
                   By MATTHEW L. WALD <span>Excerpt:
                   WASHINGTON, May 28 - The government accumulated
                   vast quantities of uranium when prices were
                   very low and no one else wanted it. But now
                   that uranium prices have increased tenfold,
                   the government has a precious commodity -
                   and some tough questions - on its hands. ...the
                   material's market value has been estimated
                   at $750 million to $3 billion, one of the
                   companies most vocal in making its case says
                   it deserves the uranium - without paying a
                   cent for it. Up for grabs is 25 million kilograms
                   of uranium hexafluoride that was incompletely
                   processed at government enrichment plants
                   when prices were very low. ...<br />
                   The lone operating enrichment plant in this
                   country, built by the old Atomic Energy Commission,
                   is in Paducah, Ky. It is run by a subsidiary
                   of USEC, a company formed in the 1990s to
                   privatize the enrichment monopoly that the
                   government had run since the days of the Manhattan
                   Project.<br />
                   The technology at the plant is outdated, and
                   USEC is struggling to commercialize a more
                   efficient system, using centrifuges, at another
                   plant, in southern Ohio. USEC will not say
                   what it thinks that project will cost, but
                   it has said it does not know how it will raise
                   the money. ...USEC officials say the Energy
                   Department could transfer much of the uranium
                   to it with the stroke of a pen.<br />
                   ...Some lawmakers on Capitol Hill say giving
                   the uranium to USEC would reward a company
                   that has not demonstrated fiscal responsibility.
                   ...Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan
                   Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy
                   and Commerce committee, said in a statement.
                   ... Congress should consider "whether
                   we should be allocating this $2 billion or
                   $3 billion to children's health insurance
                   instead of subsidizing executives who have
                   mismanaged their companies." USEC, he
                   said, had "squandered resources on multimillion-dollar
                   golden parachutes, stock buybacks and dividend
                   payments that frequently exceeded their earnings."<br />
                   ...In addition to USEC, a consortium of British,
                   Dutch and German companies has expressed interest
                   in the partly processed uranium for a centrifuge
                   plant that it is building in New Mexico, using
                   the same type of machines that have operated
                   for years in Europe....</span></p>

                   over a United Nations program that is the
                   centerpiece of international efforts to help
                   developing countries combat global warming.
                   ...the Clean Development Mechanism, ...raising
                   billions of dollars from rich countries and
                   transferring them to poor countries to curb
                   the emission of global warming gases. ...China
                   is expected to pass the United States this
                   year or next to become the world's largest
                   emitter of global warming gases. ...the Clean
                   Development Mechanism ...has grown at an extraordinary
                   pace, to $4.8 billion in transfer payments
                   to developing countries last year from less
                   than $100 million in 2002. The Clean Development
                   Mechanism ...helps advanced industrial nations
                   stay within their Kyoto Protocol limits for
                   emitting climate-changing gases like carbon
                   dioxide. For each ton of global warming gases
                   that a developing country can prove it has
                   eliminated, the secretariat of the Clean Development
                   Mechanism... awards it a credit. Developing
                   countries sold credits last year... for an
                   average price of $10.70 each. ...China captured
                   $3 billion of the $4.8 billion.... African
                   countries... totaled less than $150 million
                   last year.... Even when very poor countries
                   are able to organize development projects,
                   they may lack expertise and must sometimes
                   pay out as much as half the credits in the
                   form of fees for international consultants
                   and credit brokers. ...before manufacturers
                   can obtain the subsidies, their national governments
                   need to set up a legal framework for handling
                   the money, which some of the poorest countries
                   have not yet been able to do....The wind turbine
                   project here in Houxinqiu ...generates nearly
                   24 megawatts of electricity that would otherwise
                   come from coal. China is already building
                   enough coal-fired power plants each year to
                   light all of Britain. ...Li Guohai, a local
                   peasant ...explained how he had received free
                   electricity since the wind turbines were erected
                   four years ago. He has saved enough money
                   that he bought an all-steel plow for his mules
                   to pull; the new plow now frees his son to
                   finish junior high school and perhaps go to
                   high school, Mr. Li said. The project is narrowly
                   profitable even without Clean Development
                   Mechanism payments, Mr. Tao, the general manager,
                   said. But the payments made the project more
                   attractive and made it easier to raise money
                   for it....the wind farm saves the equivalent
                   of 35,119 tons of carbon dioxide emissions
                   a year. At $8 a credit, that is worth $281,000....</span></p>

                   Change Adds Twist to Debate Over Dams</a>.
                   By William Yardley. NY TIMES. KLAMATH FALLS,
                   Ore., April 19 -<span> Excerpt:
                   The power company that  owns  four
                   hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River says
                   the dams provide a crucial source of so-called
                   clean energy at a time when carbon emissions
                   have become one of the world's foremost environmental
                   concerns. The clean-energy argument has entered
                   a debate over dams. But the American Indians,
                   fishermen and environmentalists who want the
                   dams removed point  to what has happened
                   since the first one was built nearly 90 years
                   ago: endangered salmon have been blocked from
                   migrating, Indian livelihoods have been threatened,
                   and, more recently, the commercial fishing
                   industry off the Oregon and California coasts
                   has been devastated.. …The Klamath
                   dams provide enough power to serve about 70,000
                   homes, a small fraction of PacifiCorp's 1.6
                   million customers, which span six Western
                   states. But the company says only coal or
                   natural gas are likely to be reliable enough
                   to replace the river, which hits hydroelectric
                   turbines four times on its way to the sea
                   from east of the snow-capped Cascade Range.
                   Those who support removing the dams largely
                   dismiss the clean-energy argument, saying
                   the benefits outweigh losing a relatively
                   small source of hydropower. They note that
                   PacifiCorp's increased interest in the environment
                   comes as recent rulings by judges and federal
                   fisheries agencies have given new momentum
                   for removal. The company's federal license
                   to run the dams expired last year, and the
                   government has said PacifiCorp must build
                   fish ladders over the four dams to get a new
                   license, a proposition that could cost $300
                   million and reduce the power the dams generate,
                   potentially making removal a less costly choice……The
                   Klamath runs more than 250 miles from southwest
                   Oregon to the California coast, connecting
                   two states where power and water supply have
                   long been contentious issues……The
                   Northwest, where more than 80 percent of the
                   power generated comes from hydroelectricity,
                   has long had some of the lowest electricity
                   rates in the nation. It has also been the
                   setting for epic environmental fights that
                   reflect the tension across the region's topographic
                   and demographic divides…… </span> </p>

                   House Seeks to Cut Geothermal Research Funds</a>.
                   By Bernie Woodall. Reuters. <span>Excerpt:
                   The Bush administration wants to eliminate
                   federal support for geothermal power just
                   as many U.S. states are looking to cut greenhouse
                   gas emissions and raise renewable power output.
                   The move has angered scientists who say there
                   is enough hot water underground to meet all
                   U.S. electricity needs without greenhouse
                   gas emissions. "The Department of Energy
                   has not requested funds for geothermal research
                   in our fiscal-year 2008 budget," said
                   Christina Kielich, a spokeswoman for the Department
                   of Energy. "Geothermal is a mature technology.
                   Our focus is on breakthrough energy research
                   and development."  The administration
                   of George W. Bush has made renewable energy
                   a priority as it seeks to wean the United
                   States off foreign oil, but it emphasizes
                   use of biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel
                   for vehicles and nuclear research for electricity.
                   ... DOE requested no funding for geothermal
                   for the 2007 fiscal year, after funding averaged
                   about $26 million over the previous six years,
                   but Congress restored $5 million. This year,
                   the DOE's $24.3 billion budget request includes
                   a 38 percent federal spending increase for
                   nuclear power, but nothing for geothermal.
                   ...New geothermal power projects by 2050 could
                   provide 100,000 megawatts of electricity -
                   enough to power about 80 million U.S. homes,
                   or as much as U.S. nuclear power plants make
                   today, the MIT study said. But U.S. geothermal
                   development will need $300 million to $400
                   million over 15 years to make this type of
                   power competitive versus other forms of power

                   Weapons</a>. Catalyst magazine, Union of Concerned
                   Scientists. by Robert Nelson is a senior scientist
                   in the Global Security Program. <span>Excerpt:
                   U.S. thermonuclear weapons derive their explosive
                   energy from the combined power of nuclear
                   fission and fusion. An initial fission reaction
                   generates the high temperatures needed to
                   trigger a secondary-and much more powerful-fusion
                   reaction (hence the term "thermonuclear").
                   ...The first is the detonation of chemical
                   explosives that surrounds a sphere (or "pit")
                   of plutonium metal. The force from this blast
                   is directed inward, compressing the pit and
                   bringing its atoms closer together...sometimes
                   causing them to split, or fission....<br />
                   ...Every year since 1997, the nation's nuclear
                   weapons laboratories have certified that all
                   U.S. nuclear warheads are safe and reliable,
                   and that renewed nuclear explosive testing
                   is not currently needed to gauge reliability.
                   However, the laboratories have recently voiced
                   concern that warheads may not be reliable
                   over the long term.<br />
                   It must be noted that the definition of "unreliable" in
                   this context is a weapon that falls short
                   of its designed yield by more than 10 percent.
                   In other words, an "unreliable" nuclear
                   weapon can still produce a devastating explosion.
                   A weapon with a 300-kiloton yield could be
                   deemed unreliable if it exploded with a 270-kiloton
                   yield-13 times more energy than that released
                   by the Nagasaki bomb.<br />
                   ... the United States conducted its last nuclear
                   explosive test in 1992. Every type of U.S.
                   nuclear weapon currently deployed underwent
                   explosive testing, but it is theoretically
                   possible that the properties of the plutonium
                   could change as it ages, resulting in a weaker
                   primary.<br />
                   ...the oldest warheads in the U.S. weapons
                   stockpile were assembled almost 30 years ago.
                   Until very recently, the minimum lifetime
                   of plutonium pits was conservatively estimated
                   to be 45 years, which would mean that the
                   pits in every U.S. warhead might have to be
                   replaced within the next two decades. This
                   is the rationale behind the Bush administration's
                   proposed Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW)
                   program, which would redesign and replace
                   all 10,000 U.S. warheads.<br />
                   Over the past several years, however, the
                   U.S. weapons laboratories have effectively
                   eliminated this rationale by conducting "accelerated
                   aging" experiments to re-evaluate the
                   age at which reliability would realistically
                   decline. By simulating the behavior of aged
                   plutonium, scientists concluded that all existing
                   U.S. plutonium pits have minimum lifetimes
                   of 85 years, and most will remain reliable
                   for at least 100 years. (The lifetimes could
                   be much longer, but further experiments are
                   needed.)<br />
                   As these results make clear U.S. thermonuclear
                   weapons will remain highly reliable for many
                   decades, undercutting the primary reason for
                   the Bush administration's RRW plans....</span></p>

                   in the prospect that these blustery Allegheny
                   ridges could soon become home to the state's
                   first wind farm: 19 wind turbines, each taller
                   than the Statue of Liberty, its pedestal included. "Any
                   wind farm," Mr. Maupin said, "would
                   surely change the character of this county
                   forever." ...Where some see unwelcome
                   industrialization of the wilderness, others
                   see green energy and an estimated $200,000
                   a year in tax revenue for the financially
                   needy county. ...at Grady's Barber Shop here
                   in Monterey, the county seat, 35 miles west
                   of Staunton, Roy Waggoner said he supported
                   the $60 million project. "One way to
                   clean up the environment is with the wind
                   turbines; it's green energy," said Mr.
                   Waggoner, 57, a sheep rancher. "I don't
                   want to see them on every inch of land, but
                   that ridge is very secluded."  ...But
                   Randy Richardson, president of Highlanders
                   for Responsible Development, a group that
                   opposes the project, said people worried about
                   noise pollution from the turbines' blades
                   and light pollution from the red strobes that
                   would alert aircraft to the 400-foot-tall

                   Volume 60, Issue 2. <span>Excerpt:
                   In the midst of the US government's attempts
                   to refocus its nuclear weapons program and
                   stop the spread of nuclear weapons in hostile
                   countries, President Bush signed legislation
                   in December [2006] allowing the sale of civilian
                   nuclear fuel and technology to India and thus
                   reversed 30 years of nonproliferation policy.
                   The legislation allows US companies to sell
                   nuclear fuel to India and invest in and construct
                   new civilian nuclear power plants in that
                   country. In exchange, India will open up 14
                   of its civilian nuclear reactors to international
                   inspections but keep 8 military reactors off-limits.
                   ...The law makes India an exception to the
                   US Atomic Energy Act, which prohibits trade
                   of nuclear material with countries that haven't
                   signed the NPT. Both the US House and Senate
                   voted overwhelmingly in early December to
                   pass the legislation, with Representative
                   Tom Lantos (D-CA) saying it "ushers in
                   a new era of cooperation between our two great

                   (D-MA) termed the deal a "historic mistake" that

                   almost four ounces of enriched uranium. Interior
                   Minister Ivane Merabishvili, right, reported
                   two cases of uranium smuggling in two and
                   a half years. The Russian, Oleg Khinsagov,
                   had come to meet a buyer who he believed would
                   pay him $1 million and deliver the material
                   to a Muslim man from "a serious organization," the
                   authorities say. The uranium was a sample,
                   just under four ounces, and the deal a test:
                   If all went smoothly, he boasted, he would
                   sell a far larger cache stored in his apartment
                   back in Vladikavkaz, two to three kilograms
                   of the rare material, four and a half to six
                   and a half pounds, which in expert hands is
                   enough to make a small bomb. The buyer, it
                   turned out, was a Georgian agent. Alerted
                   to Mr. Khinsagov's ambitions by spies in South
                   Ossetia, Georgian officials arrested him and
                   confiscated his merchandise. After a secret
                   trial, the smuggler was sentenced to eight
                   and a half years in prison. ...The old Soviet
                   empire had a vast network of nuclear facilities.
                   After its breakup, as managers abandoned plants
                   and security fell apart, the West grew alarmed
                   as many cases of atomic smuggling came to
                   light. ...Since 2000, however, the amounts
                   and purity of the seized material has declined
                   as former Soviet republics set up new security
                   precautions, often financed by the United
                   States. ...Georgians called for help from
                   American diplomats, who sent in experts from
                   the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
                   Department of Energy, American officials say.
                   Mr. Merabishvili said the Americans shocked
                   them by taking the uranium and simply putting
                   it "in their pocket." Uranium in
                   that form emits little radiation and presents
                   little or no danger to its handlers. When
                   it was analyzed at the Energy Department's
                   laboratory in the Pacific Northwest, it was
                   found to have a U-235 purity of 89.451 percent, "suitable
                   for certain types of research reactors, as
                   a source material for medical isotope production,
                   and for military purposes including nuclear
                   weapons."</span></p>

                   Says Tapping of Granite Could Unleash Energy
                   Source</a>. By ANDREW C. REVKIN, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   The United States could generate as much electricity
                   by 2050 as that flowing today from all of
                   the country's nuclear power plants by developing
                   technologies that tap heat locked in deep
                   layers of granite, according to a new study
                   commissioned by the Energy Department. ...The
                   new report, published online yesterday, focuses
                   on a process that it said could affordably
                   harvest heat locked in deep layers of granite
                   that exist almost everywhere on earth. The
                   technique, called enhanced geothermal, involves
                   drilling several holes - some two to three
                   miles deep - into granite that has been held
                   at chicken-roasting temperatures, around 400
                   degrees or more, by insulating layers of rock
                   above. In the right geological conditions,
                   pressurized water can be used to widen natural
                   mazelike arrays of cracks in the granite,
                   creating a vast, porous subterranean reservoir.
                   In a typical setup, water pumped down into
                   the reservoir through one hole absorbs heat
                   from the rock and flows up another hole to
                   a power plant, giving up its heat to generate
                   steam and electricity before it is recirculated
                   in the rock below.There are successful plants
                   harvesting heat from deep hot rock in Australia,
                   Europe and Japan, the report noted, adding
                   that studies of the technology largely stopped
                   in the United States after a brief burst of
                   research during the oil crises of the 1970s.
                   ...The generating capacity by 2050 could be
                   100 billion watts, about 10 percent of the
                   country's current generating capacity....</span></p>

                     Wind, almost everybody's best hope for big
                     supplies of clean, affordable electricity,
                     is turning out to have complications. Engineers
                     have cut the price of electricity derived
                     from wind by about 80 percent in the last
                     20 years, setting up this renewable technology
                     for a major share of the electricity market.
                     But ...wind also ...is unpredictable and
                     often fails to blow when electricity is
                     most needed, ....power plants that run on
                     coal or gas must "be built along with
                     every megawatt of wind capacity," said
                     William Bojorquez, director of system planning
                     at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
                     ... in Texas, and most of the United States,
                     the hottest days are the least windy. ...A
                     wind machine is a bit like a bicycle that
                     a commuter keeps in the garage for sunny
                     days. It saves gasoline, but the commuter
                     has to own a car anyway.<br />
                     ...Frank P. Prager, managing director of
                     environmental policy at [Xcel Energy], said
                     ...that in one of the states the company
                     serves, Colorado, if ...wind machines reach
                     20 percent of total generating capacity,
                     the cost of standby generators will reach
                     $8 a megawatt-hour of wind. That is on top
                     of a generating cost of $50 or $60 a megawatt-hour,
                     after including a federal tax credit of
                     $18 a megawatt-hour. By contrast, electricity
                     from a new coal plant currently costs in
                     the range of $33 to $41 a megawatt-hour,
                     according to experts. That price, however,
                     would rise if the carbon dioxide produced
                     in burning coal were taxed, a distinct possibility
                     over the life of a new coal plant. (A megawatt-hour
                     is the amount of power that a large hospital
                     or a Super Wal-Mart would use in an hour.)
                     Without major advances in ways to store
                     large quantities of electricity ..., wind
                     may run up against its practical limits
                     sooner than expected. ...In May, Xcel and
                     the Energy Department announced a research
                     program to use surplus, off-peak electricity
                     from wind to split water molecules into
                     hydrogen and oxygen. ...But storage imposes
                     a high cost: about half the energy put into
                     the system is lost. The Electric Power Research
                     Institute said that existing hydroelectric
                     dams could be used as storage; they can
                     increase and decrease their generation quickly,
                     and each watt generated in a wind machine
                     means water need not be run through the
                     dam's turbines; it can be kept in storage,
                     ready for use later, when it is most needed.<br />
                     ...the amount of energy that the average
                     wind turbine produces over 12 months is
                     equal to just 30 to 40 percent of the amount
                     that would result from year-round operation
                     at capacity. That number runs closer to
                     90 percent at a nuclear or coal plant. Thus
                     a 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant will produce
                     nearly three times as much electricity as
                     1,000 megawatts of wind turbines. But operating
                     costs at the wind farm are lower, and the
                     fuel is, of course, free.</span></p>
<p>[Comment from Alan Gould:
                   the article does not explore possibility "distributed
                   storage" i.e. each home (or neighborhood)
                   having enough battery storage to get through
                   cloudy/rainy/non-windy days. Distributed storage
                   is the perfect match for distributed photovoltaic
                   systems. Also, the article's figures about
                   relative costs of wind and coal energy may
                   have the classic flaw of not factoring in
                   environmental costs for the coal energy.]</p>

                     By FELICITY BARRINGER, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     WASHINGTON, A fourfold increase in the price
                     of uranium in the past three years has led
                     to a rush of new claims by uranium companies,
                     according to a new survey by an environmental
                     group that wants to inform the public of
                     potentially harmful consequences. Mining
                     claim data compiled by the Environmental
                     Working Group, Washington-based environmental
                     research specialists, shows that, in Colorado,
                     Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, the total
                     claims rose from just over 2,000 in 2001
                     to about 18,000 in 2005. ..."There's
                     a renaissance of people's attitudes toward
                     nuclear energy as a viable green, clean,
                     clean-air type of energy sources," said
                     Paul Matysek, president of the Vancouver-based
                     firm Energy Metals Corporation. And, Mr.
                     Matysek added, the increase in oil and natural-gas
                     prices, even though they have eased in recent
                     months, has spurred a mini-boom in the price
                     of the metal.<br />
  "Three years ago it was $12 or $14" a pound, he said. "Today
  it's $65.50." ...Environmental groups said that ... the
  consequences could be severe. ...In Nevada, for instance, the
  environmental group's research found more than 166,000 new
  claims, covering more than 3.5 million acres of public land.
  ...only a tiny fraction of all claims - usually less than a
  tenth of one percent - are ever mined. But the scars of open-pit
  mining are visible in many places on the Environmental Working
  Group's Web site [http://www.ewg.org/], .... Still, said Mark
  Kuchta, an associate professor of mining engineering at the
  Colorado School of Mines, uranium mining in the future will
  have far less impact than the mines and the associated mills
  in the past. Increased cancer deaths have occurred near at
  least one old uranium mining sites. "The environmental
  laws have changed," Mr. Kuchta said. "In order to
  build the mine, there's a plethora of permits" needed.
  He added, "You can't just leave them on the surface and
  walk away the way you used to do."</span></p>

                     The TXU Corporation is embarking on its
                     next monumental task: the nation's single
                     largest coal-oriented construction campaign,
                     with a plan to add more than 9,000 megawatts
                     of new capacity, the equivalent of 3.5 percent
                     of the nation's current coal-fired capacity.
                     That is enough to power millions of homes.
                     For people who want to limit global warming
                     gases, the moves by TXU, which is based
                     in Dallas, are a reminder that outside the
                     laboratories and hearing rooms where scientists
                     and policy makers talk about limiting carbon
                     emissions, some power companies are racing
                     to build infrastructure that will put carbon
                     into the atmosphere into the middle of this
                     century or longer. Whatever the cost to
                     the ecosystem, it could be an immensely
                     profitable bet. Company executives say the
                     plants will provide cheap electricity for

                     the pollutants that make smog. Texas has
                     no goals for cutting carbon emissions. Nationally,
                     the [energy] industry expects 19 percent
                     growth over the next decade; in Texas, it
                     is 25 percent. The state's peak electric

                              (Ted) Chang have developed a potentially
                              cheap and efficient way of removing
                              mercury from coal-fired power plant

                              technique involves injecting a
                              specially formulated gas into the
                              mercury-laden flue gas of a coal-fired
                              power plant, where it can convert
                              elemental mercury into oxidized
                              mercury, a form more easily captured
                              by existing pollution control devices.<br />
                                ...The problem is also global.
                                China's booming coal combustion
                                industry emits more than 200
                                tons of mercury per year into
                                the atmosphere, some of which
                                drifts to the U.S.<br />
                                Over time, some of the mercury
                                released into the environment
                                by power plants changes to methylmercury,
                                which is a potent neurotoxin
                                that is known to be detrimental
                                to developing fetuses and young
                                children. It is passed from prey
                                to predator along the food chain,
                                building up in certain types
                                of fish and shellfish that people
                                love to eat. In fact, methylmercury
                                can accumulate in fish and marine
                                mammals in concentrations hundreds

                     Department Rejects Interim Plan for Nuclear
                     Waste.</a> By MARTIN STOLZ and MATTHEW L.
                     WALD. NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     SKULL VALLEY, Utah, Sept. 8 - The Interior
                     Department has moved to block a huge "interim" nuclear
                     waste storage plant on an Indian reservation
                     here, citing a lack of confidence that it
                     would truly be temporary because there is
                     so much doubt about completion of a permanent
                     repository, at Yucca Mountain, Nev. ...The
                     decision was hailed by many elected officials
                     in Utah, which has no reactors, and where
                     many non-Indians oppose the plan. But John
                     D. Parkyn, the chairman of the board of
                     Private Fuel Storage, the consortium, said
                     in a telephone interview on Friday that
                     the opinion about Yucca Mountain was contrary
                     to federal policy and that there were various
                     errors in the decision. One, Mr. Parkyn
                     said, is that the decision said development
                     on the reservation would require a tribal
                     police force. But in fact, he said, the
                     plant would have only about 20 employees,
                     and most of those would be guards. If tribal
                     police were somehow required, he said, the
                     project would pay for them. ...The tribe
                     is divided over the project. A proponent,
                     Garth Jerry Bear, said Friday at his home
                     on the reservation that the plant would
                     provide hope for the desperately poor members,
                     good-paying jobs and money for schools.
                     ...Sammy Blackbear, an opponent of the storage
                     plan, said he was elated by the decision.<br />
  "It should have come a long time ago,'' Mr. Blackbear
  said, "but this is better late than never."</span></p>

                     <span>Excerpt: ...The
                     United States reached a wind energy milestone
                     earlier this year: 10,000 megawatts (MW)
                     of total generating capacity, or enough
                     to power more than 2.5 million homes. ...Though
                     the U.S. wind industry continues to expand
                     at a rapid pace, the cost of developing
                     a wind power project has actually increased
                     over the past 18 months, in some cases significantly.
                     The uncertainty of federal production incentives
                   has deterred manufacturers from building assembly
                   plants in the United States, requiring most
                   turbines to be imported, and foreign-made
                   turbines have become more expensive as the
                   value of the U.S. dollar has fallen. At the
                   same time, high global demand has caused most
                   turbine manufacturers to sell out through
                   2008, and the cost of steel and other materials
                   has risen sharply due mostly to higher fossil
                   fuel prices. Other factors include the difficulties
                   associated with using more sophisticated electronic
                   components and increased profit margins by
                   manufacturers.<br />
                   Fortunately, none of these obstacles are insurmountable.
                   Higher fossil fuel prices have driven up the
                   cost of conventional power generation, enabling
                   wind power to remain cost-competitive.<br />
                   ...Two exciting new technologies hold out
                   the promise of consistent growth for the wind
                   industry in the coming decades: turbines that
                   can be set in deep offshore waters, and land-based
                   turbines that can operate cost-effectively
                   at lower wind speeds....</span></p>

                     Kenneth Perry - Boulder, Wyoming: In suggesting
                     that the US should turn to wind-generated
                     electric power (see PHYSICS TODAY, July
                     2005, page 34), Cristina Archer and Mark
                     Jacobson fail to discuss the visual impact
                     of wind farms.... Terry Goldman, Los Alamos,
                     New Mexico:<br />
                     As a free-standing, reliable, and stable
                     source of energy, wind power is totally
                     inadequate; even as a secondary, supportive
                     source, it has serious limitations. Due
                     to the character of wind, power is not produced
                     in a steady stream over a long period but
                     in a succession of spikes between zero and
                     full power. The fluctuation makes reliable
                     management of the power grid very risky.
                     Moreover, wind power generation delivers
                     only a modest fraction (20% to 25%) of the
                     installed power capacity....<br />
                     Archer and Jacobson comment: Kenneth Perry
                     suggests that wind turbines interfere with
                     nature's beauty. We believe, though, that
                     the correct comparison is not with nature's
                     beauty but with the visual, health, and
                     climate impacts of coal, natural gas, and
                     nuclear power plants (see, for example, <a href="http://www.fotosearch.com/photos-images/coal-burning-plant.html" target="_blank">http://www.fotosearch.com/photos-images/coal-burning-plant.html</a>),
                     which is what wind turbines would be replacing.
                     ...Frits de Wette contends that the intermittency
                     of wind makes power management of a wind-energy-dominated
                     grid risky. This is true when wind farms
                     are not linked together in an organized
                     manner through the transmission grid, but
                     not true if they are. We have shown in a
                     new study that interconnecting up to 19
                     wind farms several hundred kilometers apart
                     converts an intermittent wind resource to
                     one that produces about one-third of its
                     electric power at the same reliability as
                     the average US coal-fired power plant-which
                     has a 12.5% outage rate. Remaining electricity
                     can be firmed with hydroelectric, geothermal,
                     solar, or other power. The website for Red
                     ElŽctrica, which operates Spain's electric
                     power system (http://www.ree.es/ingles/i-index_de.html),
                     further shows, as an example, that linking
                     most of Spain's wind farms through a common
                     grid would eliminate minute-by-minute fluctuations
                     that occur at a single wind farm.<br />
                     ...Terry Goldman suggests that large-scale
                     wind farming will cause significant bird
                     loss. Statistics suggest otherwise. According
                     to the Bird Conservancy, the 15 000 existing
                     US wind turbines kill 10 000 to 40 000 birds
                     per year, which compares with 50 million
                     US bird deaths per year due to transmission
                     towers and 200 million worldwide due to
                     avian flu in 2005. Extrapolating to 5 million
                     5-MW turbines needed to satisfy all electric
                     power and energy needs worldwide gives 3
                     million to 13 million bird deaths per year,
                     much less than transmission towers in the
                     US alone. -Cristina Archer<br />

                     OIL SLICK - UN Warns of Environmental Disaster</a> -
                     Spiegel Online -<span> Excerpt:
                     While the war rages on, a huge environmental
                     disaster is threatening Lebanon's coast.
                     Up to 35,000 tons of oil have spilled into
                     the Mediterranean following Israeli air
                     strikes -- now it is a race against time
                     to prevent long-term damage and the destruction
                     of a fragile ecosystem. The Lebanese government
                     is calling it the biggest ecological catastrophe
                     in the country's history. Between July 13
                     and 15, Israeli jets bombed the Jiyyeh power
                     station, located 30 kilometers south of
                     Beirut, and caused up to 35,000 tons of
                     fuel oil to gush into the sea. The oil slick
                     has now spread along 80 kilometers of Lebanon's
                     225 kilometer coastline and has already
                     reached Syria. A clean up operation is badly
                     needed, but continuing hostilities between
                     the Israeli army and Hezbollah have made
                     this virtually impossible. Now, the catastrophe
                     is threatening to damage the environment
                     across many parts of the Mediterranean.
                     ...As bad as the Exxon Valdez?<br />
                     In an interview with the BBC, the ministry's
                     director general, Berj Hatjian, compared
                     the oil slick to that caused by the Exxon
                     Valdez tanker, "with 20,000 to 30,000
                     tons reaching the shoreline." When
                     the tanker sank off the coast of Alaska
                     in 1989, 40,000 tons of oil were released
                     into the sea. The result was the worst ever
                     maritime environmental disaster. Hundreds
                     of thousands of animals died, and because
                     the oil spill could not be completely cleaned
                     up animals are still being poisoned today.
                     The environmental impact of the current
                     oil slick is not confined to Lebanon and
                     risks spreading through the Mediterranean.

                     Response Center (Rempec), based in Malta,
                     has already recorded the first traces of
                     oil on the Syrian coast -- confirming reports

                     cost, $8.87 billion, was so far overbudget

                     For the industry, the larger concern was
                     economics. ...Vogtle was intended to generate
                     a total of around 4,500 megawatts of electricity,
                     enough power to serve the needs of several
                     million homes. The grand plan was to have
                     four reactors. Instead, it was scaled back
                     to two, .... Today these reactors together
                     produce about 2,400 megawatts, satisfying
                     about 15 percent of the state's power needs. </span></p>

                   power revival - Political interest in nuclear
                   power is reviving across the world, thanks
                   in part to concerns about global warming and
                   energy security. Currently some 441 commercial
                   reactors operate in 31 countries and provide
                   17% of the planet's electricity, according
                   to a US Department of Energy report cited
                   in the June 3rd The Economist. Until recently
                   the talk was of how to retire these reactors
                   gracefully, but now it is of how to extend
                   their lives. And in addition another 32 reactors
                   are being built, mostly in India, China and
                   their neighbors. The new 'third generation'
                   reactors are considered by their creators
                   to be safer than their predecessors. Further
                   into the future, engineers are developing
                   designs for so-called 'fourth generation'
                   plants that could be built between 2030 and
                   2040. Work on these designs is being undertaken
                   by a ten-nation research program whose members
                   include the US, Britain, China, France, Japan,
                   South Africa and South Korea. (See <a href="http://www.economist.com/">http://www.economist.com</a>)</span></p>

                     - NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     SCHWARZE PUMPE, Germany - In the shadow
                     of two hulking boilers, which spew 10 million
                     tons of carbon dioxide a year into the air,
                     the Swedish owners of this coal-fired power
                     station recently broke ground on what is
                     to be the world's first carbon-free plant
                     fueled by coal. The German chancellor, Angela
                     Merkel, presided over the ceremony. ..."We
                     accept the problem of climate change," said
                     Reinhardt Hassa, a senior executive at Vattenfall,
                     which operates the plant. "If we want
                     a future for coal, we have to adopt new
                     technologies. It is not enough just to make
                     incremental improvements." But the
                     new plant, which will be just a demonstration
                     model, pales next to the eight coal-fired
                     power stations Germany plans to build for
                     commercial use between from now to 2011
                     - none of them carbon-free. "That is
                     really a disappointing track record," said
                     Stephan Singer, the director of climate
                     and energy policy at the World Wide Fund
                     for Nature in Brussels. "Just replacing
                     old coal plants with new coal plants won't
                     enable Germany to meet stricter carbon emission
                     targets." ...The recent spike in the
                     price of oil has thrown the spotlight back
                     on coal, even in places like Britain, where
                     the industry had been in a death spiral
                     for decades. Richard Budge, a longtime British
                     coal executive, ...noted [...coal] is not
                     a hostage to politics. When Russia abruptly
                     switched off its natural gas pipeline to
                     Ukraine in January over a pricing dispute,
                     gas supplies dwindled all over Western Europe.
                     ..."Fifty-eight percent of the world's
                     gas is owned by Russia, Iran and Qatar," Mr.
                     Budge said. "Coal is on every continent."  ...
                     in eastern Germany, ...So great is the demand
                     that the government allows companies to
                     forcibly resettle villages that lie in the
                     path of their excavators. The process is
                     costly and litigious and can take more than

                     Revives Nuclear Power Plan</a> By IAN AUSTEN.
                     NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     OTTAWA, June 13 - In an effort to revive
                     a nuclear energy program that has been marred
                     by billions of dollars in debt, cost overruns
                     and disappointing performance, the province
                     of Ontario on Tuesday announced a plan to
                     spend about 20 billion Canadian dollars
                     ($18 billion [US]) to build reactors and
                     refurbish some current units.<br />
                     The plan also includes about 20 billion
                     Canadian dollars for renewable energy projects
                     and 6 billion Canadian dollars ($5.3 billion)
                     for power conservation. ...Vaughan Gilbert,
                     a spokesman for Westinghouse Nuclear, which
                     is based in Monroeville, Pa., and owned
                     by BNFL of Britain, said, "We've been
                     gearing up for this even though the market
                     for new plants in North America had dried
                     up." If completed as envisioned, the
                     plan will maintain the current level of
                     nuclear-generated power, which provides
                     about half of Ontario's electricity. The
                     other half is provided mainly by hydro-electric
                     dams and coal. ...3 of Ontario's 19 reactors
                     are not in use.<br />
                     A Conservative government that preceded
                     Mr. Duncan and the Liberals restructured
                     the province's government-owned electrical
                     system as a prelude to privatization. But
                     a variety of problems, including a political
                     scandal tied to utility executives' salaries,
                     meant that the province never saw a major
                     influx of privately owned power-generating
                     companies.<br />
                     Those issues recently forced Mr. Duncan
                     to back away from a campaign pledge to close
                     by 2009 the coal-fired generating stations.
                     ...The project will initially involve at
                     least two units at a cost of about 2 billion
                     Canadian dollars each. ...Mark Winfield,
                     the director of environmental governance
                     at the Pembina Institute for Appropriate
                     Development, predicted that the province
                     would only experience further financial
                     grief by recommitting to nuclear generation. "It's
                     a very strange approach and a very high-risk
                     one as well," he said. Mr. Winfield
                     said he was skeptical that nuclear power
                     generation would succeed financially this
                     time around, and said the government was
                     underestimating the full potential of energy
                     conservation.</span></p>

                     HANJING, China - One of China's lesser-known
                     exports is a dangerous brew of soot, toxic
                     chemicals and climate-changing gases from
                     the smokestacks of coal-burning power plants.
                     In early April, a dense cloud of pollutants
                     over Northern China sailed to nearby Seoul,
                     sweeping along dust and desert sand before
                     wafting across the Pacific. An American
                     satellite spotted the cloud as it crossed
                     the West Coast. Researchers in California,
                     Oregon and Washington noticed specks of
                     sulfur compounds, carbon and other byproducts
                     of coal combustion coating the silvery surfaces
                     of their mountaintop detectors. These microscopic
                     particles can work their way deep into the
                     lungs, contributing to respiratory damage,
                     heart disease and cancer. Filters near Lake
                     Tahoe in the mountains of eastern California "are
                     the darkest that we've seen" outside
                     smoggy urban areas, said Steven S. Cliff,
                     an atmospheric scientist at the University
                     of California at Davis.<br />
                     Unless China finds a way to clean up its
                     coal plants and the thousands of factories
                     that burn coal, pollution will soar both
                     at home and abroad. The increase in global-warming
                     gases from China's coal use will probably
                     exceed that for all industrialized countries
                     combined over the next 25 years, surpassing
                     by five times the reduction in such emissions
                     that the Kyoto Protocol seeks.... Coal is
                     indeed China's double-edged sword - the
                     new economy's black gold and the fragile
                     environment's dark cloud. Already, China
                     uses more coal than the United States, the
                     European Union and Japan combined. ...Every
                     week to 10 days, another coal-fired power
                     plant opens somewhere in China that is big
                     enough to serve all the households in Dallas
                     or San Diego. To make matters worse, India
                     is right behind China in stepping up its
                     construction of coal-fired power plants
                     - and has a population expected to outstrip
                     China's by 2030. ...Two years ago, Datong,
                     long the nation's coal capital, was branded
                     one of the world's most-polluted cities.
                     Since then, the air quality has only grown
                     worse. Datong is so bad that last winter
                     the city's air quality monitors went on
                     red alert. Desert dust and particulate matter
                     in the city had been known to force the
                     pollution index into warning territory,
                     above 300, which means people should stay
                     indoors.<br />
                     On Dec. 28, the index hit 350. ...The Chinese
                     are still far from achieving what has become
                     the basic standard in the West. Urban elites
                     who can afford condominiums are still a
                     tiny fraction of China's population. But
                     these urban elites are role models with
                     a lifestyle sought by hundreds of millions
                     of Chinese. Plush condos on sale in Shanghai
                     are just a step toward an Americanized lifestyle
                     that is becoming possible in the nation's
                     showcase city....</span></p>

                     OAKLAND, Md. - Dan Boone ...wants to slow
                     the growth of wind-power projects. For four
                     years or more, Mr. Boone has traveled across
                     the mid-Atlantic to make every argument
                     he can muster against local wind-power projects:
                     they kill birds and bats; they are too noisy;
                     they are inefficient, making no more than
                     a symbolic contribution to energy needs.<br />
... in the mountainous terrain of southwestern Pennsylvania,
western Maryland or West Virginia, areas where 15 new projects
have been proposed. If all were built, 750 to 1,000 giant turbines
would line the hilltops, most producing, on average, enough electricity
to power 600 homes.<br />
..."The broader environmental movement knows we have this
urgent need for renewable energy to avert global warming," said
John Passacantando, executive director of Greenpeace U.S.A. "But
we're still dealing with groups that can't get their heads around
global warming yet."<br />
...Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s very public opposition to the 130-turbine
Cape Wind energy facility proposed off Nantucket Sound has driven
a wedge between activists.<br />
...Mr. Boone's quiver of anti-wind arguments includes economic
analyses, but his first line of attack is biological: he contends
that they are a threat to bats and potentially to migratory birds
and that they break up forest habitat. Scores of raptors and
other birds were killed by the first generation of wind turbines
set up at Altamont Pass in Northern California. Since the Altamont
Pass turbines were erected in the early 1980's, turbine design
has been altered, and most subsequent studies have shown that
birds tend to fly above the height of most turbines though some
experts say more studies are needed. But the turbines south of
here in Thomas, W.Va., have been lethal to bats. More than 2,000
were killed in 2003 at the Mountaineer project, whose 44 turbines
are owned by FPL Energy, a big power company that is the wind
industry's dominant player. Industry officials agree that the
bat mortality measured at the Mountaineer site is unacceptable,
and they are studying the benefits of deterrent devices and the
best ways to modify turbine operations in bat-rich areas....</span></p>

                     blustery Wyoming politician named Fenimore
                     Chatterton boasted that his state alone
                     had enough coal to "weld every tie
                     that binds, drive every wheel, change the
                     North Pole into a tropical region, or smelt
                     all hell!"...His words seem prophetic.
                     The future for American energy users is
                     playing out in coal-rich areas like northeastern
                     Wyoming, where dump trucks and bulldozers
                     swarm around 80-foot-thick seams at a Peabody
                     Energy strip mine here, one of the largest
                     in the world. Coal, the nation's favorite
                     fuel in much of the 19th century and early
                     20th century, could become so again in the
                     21st. The United States has enough to last
                     at least two centuries at current use rates

                     or natural gas. ... The decisions being
                     made right now in industry and government
                     on how quickly to adopt any new but more
                     costly technologies will be monumental. 
                     "Coal isn't going away, so you have
                     to think ahead," said Gavin A. Schmidt,
                     a climate modeler at the Goddard Institute
                     for Space Studies, part of NASA. "Many
                     of these power stations are built to last
                     50 years." ...Gregory Boyce... was
                     chairman of an advisory panel for the Energy
                     Department, organized by the National Coal
                     Council, that produced a controversial report
                     in March calling for exemptions to the Clean
                     Air Act to encourage greater consumption
                     of coal through 2025. The thrust of the
                     report, which Mr. Boyce outlined in an interview,
                     is that improvements in technology to limit
                     carbon dioxide emissions should be left
                     to the market instead of government regulation.
                     ...Led by Peabody, dozens of energy companies
                     have embarked on the most ambitious construction
                     of coal-fired electricity plants since the
                     1950's. ...While Peabody supports some coal
                     gasification projects, it remains skeptical
                     about departing from traditional coal-burning
                     methods to produce electricity. The pulverized
                     coal plants it wants to build, which grind
                     coal into a dust before burning it to make
                     electricity, currently cost about $2 billion
                     each, or 15 percent to 20 percent less to
                     build than the cleaner "integrated
                     gasification combined cycle," or I.G.C.C.,
                     plants, which convert coal into a gas. ...Engineers
                     have known how to make gas from coal for
                     more than a century, using this method in
                     the gaslights that first illuminated many
                     American cities. A handful of coal gasification
                     plants are already in operation in the United
                     States, Spain and the Netherlands, ...As
                     they proceed with plans to build pulverized
                     coal plants, Peabody and other companies
                     often point to their support of the alternative
                     technology through their participation in
                     Futuregen, a $1 billion project started
                     three years ago by the Bush administration
                     to build a showcase 275-megawatt power station
                     that could sequester carbon dioxide and
                     reduce other pollutants.... </span>

                     Finds New Uranium Traces in Iran.</a> By
                     WILLIAM J. BROAD. NYTimes. <span>Exceprt:
                     Atomic inspectors have found traces of highly
                     enriched uranium on equipment linked to
                     an Iranian military base, raising new questions
                     about whether Iran harbors a clandestine
                     program to make nuclear bombs, diplomats
                     said yesterday. It is the second such discovery
                     in three years of United Nations inspections
                     in Iran. As the Security Council debates
                     how to handle the atomic impasse with Tehran,
                     the finding is likely to deepen skepticism
                     about Iran's claims that its program is
                     entirely peaceful...."There are still
                     lots of questions," a senior European
                     diplomat said. "So it's not a smoking
                     gun." 
                     ...Highly enriched uranium contains 20 percent
                     or more of a rare form of uranium, known
                     as its 235 isotope. Bomb-grade uranium is
                     usually defined as 80 percent or more, and
                     can be fashioned into the core of a nuclear
                     weapon. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima contained
                     140 pounds of highly enriched uranium. The
                     senior European diplomat said the samples
                     from Iran indicated the presence of highly
                     enriched, but not necessarily bomb-grade,
                     uranium. Iran says its atomic program is
                     meant to enrich uranium to the relatively
                     low grades needed for the production of
                     electrical power in nuclear reactors, about
                     3 or 4 percent, a level that the inspectors
                     recently confirmed. ... </span>

                     Today, page 25. Jim Dawson. Yucca Mountain,
                     Nevada. <span>Excerpt:
                     Some 20 years and $8.6 billion after Yucca
                     Mountain in Nevada was first rated by the
                     US Department of Energy as the best site
                     in the country to permanently store tens
                     of thousands of tons of high-level nuclear
                     waste, the Bush administration is beginning
                     a new push to get the languishing project
                     moving. But the new initiative, a legislative
                     proposal DOE Secretary Samuel Bodman sent
                     to Congress in early April, faces a difficult
                     time on Capitol Hill. ...In a letter to
                     the Senate and House that accompanied the
                     legislative proposal, Bodman said the "existence
                     of a repository at Yucca Mountain is critical
                     to the expanded use of nuclear power." Even
                     with the administration's new proposal for
                     a global nuclear energy partnership, which
                     focuses on recycling nuclear waste instead
                     of storing it, Bodman said the Yucca repository "will
                     continue to be necessary to deal with the
                     spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
                     waste that will be generated by those [recycling]
                     technologies." Currently about 55 000
                     metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
                     radioactive waste are stored at more than
                     100 sites in 39 states, according to DOE
                     officials. An additional 2000 metric tons
                     of high-level nuclear waste is being generated
                     each year. The proposed legislation calls
                     for several specific actions by Congress
                     to make the development of the Yucca site
                     possible. DOE asks that 147 000 acres of
                     land surrounding Yucca Mountain, which is
                     located about 90 miles northwest of Las
                     Vegas, be withdrawn from public use. Possession
                     of the land by DOE is one of the NRC requirements
                     for granting a license to build the facility.
                     The legislation would also repeal the 70
                     000-metric-ton capacity limitation for waste
                     storage at the facility and allow the limit
                     to "be determined by the actual physical
                     capacity of the mountain." ... the
                     US Environmental Protection Agency is expected
                     to announce in the next several months a
                     new standard for limiting radiation exposure
                     at the Yucca repository for a one-million-year
                     period. The revised standard is needed since
                     the previous standard, based on the repository's
                     being safe for 10 000 years, was thrown
                     out in 2004 by the US Court of Appeals in
                     the District of Columbia because it was
                     not "based on and consistent with" an
                     earlier National Academy of Sciences radiation
                     peak-dose safety recommendation.... </span>

                     money, will begin installing the first of
                     what will be 52,000 solar panels, capable
                     of generating 11 megawatts of electricity
                     - enough to light and heat 8,000 homes.
                     ..."It takes a huge amount of work
                     to develop these projects, to get the permits,
                     to find the modules, and solar energy still
                     costs more than fossil fuels or wind," 
                     Mr. Marsden said. "So we are only going
                     to invest in countries with supportive regimes." That
                     list does not yet include the United States.
                     Richard King, a team leader in the Energy
                     Department's photovoltaic research group,
                     said that many homeowners, particularly
                     in California, had installed rooftop panels,
                     as had some Wal-Mart stores and other businesses.
                     But Mr. King conceded that American economics
                     did not yet favor solar energy. He said
                     that people in Portugal and many other parts
                     of Europe were already accustomed to paying
                     25 cents to 30 cents a kilowatt hour for
                     electricity. In the United States, the cost
                     still averages 10 cents to 14 cents, "and
                     utilities are just not going to buy 25-cent
                     solar electricity,"

                     for fiscal year (FY) 2007, the Department
                     of Energy (DOE) requested $544.5 million
                     in new spending for the proposed high-level
                     nuclear waste storage facility in the Yucca
                     Mountain range near Las Vegas, Nevada. This
                     request reflects an almost $100 million
                     increase in spending on Yucca mountain from
                     the $450 million that Congress appropriated
                     for FY 2006. ...U.S. nuclear power plants
                     have already generated more than 40,000
                     tons of high-level waste (a small portion
                     of this is a byproduct of U.S. nuclear weapons
                     production activities). This highly lethal
                     stockpile is currently stored around the
                     country at commercial and government facilities,
                     and it continues to grow rapidly, as current
                     nuclear power production adds 2,000 tons
                     of waste to the existing pile every year.
                     Industry pressure for a solution is mounting;
                     the federal government was scheduled to
                     assume responsibility for this waste nearly
                     a decade ago. If DOE fails to move the waste
                     to a federal repository, power plants that
                     run out of on-site storage space will be
                     forced to shut down. ...in April 2005, Energy
                     Secretary Samuel Bodman publicly acknowledged
                     that water flow and quality assurance data
                     for the Yucca Mountain site could have been
                     falsified. DOE's own investigation and Congressional
                     inquiries into United States Geological
                     Service computer modeling of climate and
                     water infiltration at the site uncovered
                     numerous e-mail exchanges, dating back to
                     1998 and 2000, in which government scientists
                     discussed fabricating documentation for
                     a key scientific study about ground water
                     penetration into the repository and admitted

                   in particular, fossil fuel sources. There
                   is now a waiting list for the Windsource program
                   in Colorado. We could view this as a watershed
                   moment in the history of electrical energy
                   production: as fossil fuel costs continue
                   to increase in ever accelerating fashion,
                   costs of alternative electrical energy production
                   does not increase nearly fast. We knew that
                   inevitably, alternative sustainable energy
                   sources would be cheaper than fossil fuel
                   sources. We just did not know how soon that
                   would happen. But as the Colorado situation
                   shows, it's happening sooner than some people
                   expected. Next milestone to look for: when

                            a ravenous thirst for oil, has joined China in an 
                            increasingly naked grab at oil and natural gas fields 
                            that has the world's two most populous nations bidding 
                            up energy prices and racing against each other and 
                            global energy companies. Energy economists in the 
                            West cannot help admiring the success of both China 
                            and India in kindling their industrialization furnaces. 
                            But they also cannot help worrying about what the 
                            effect will be on energy supplies as the 37 percent 
                            of the world's population that lives in these two 
                            countries rushes to catch up with Europe, the United 
                            States and Japan. And environmentalists worry about 
                            the effects on global warming from the two nations' 
                            plans to burn more fossil fuels.

                              TOKYO, Wednesday, Aug. 11 - A section of steam pipe 
                              that blew out Monday, killing four workers at a 
                              Japanese nuclear power plant, had not been inspected 
                              in 28 years and had corroded from nearly half an 
                              inch to a thickness little greater than metal foil, 
                              authorities said Tuesday.... Although the carbon 
                              steel pipe carried 300-degree steam at high pressure, 
                              it had not been inspected since the power plant 
                              opened in 1976. In April 2003, Nihon Arm, a maintenance 
                              subcontractor, informed the Kansai Electric Power 
                              Company, the plant owner, that there could be a 
                              problem. Last November, the power company scheduled 
                              an ultrasound inspection for Saturday. "We thought 
                              we could postpone the checks until this month," 
                              Akira Kokado, the deputy plant manager, told reporters 
                              at Mihama. "We had never expected such rapid corrosion." 
                              But on Monday, four days before the scheduled shutdown 
                              for the inspection, superheated steam blew a two-foot-wide 
                              hole in the pipe, scalding four workmen to death 
                              and injuring five others seriously. The steam that 
                              escaped was not in contact with the nuclear reactor, 
                              and no nuclear contamination has been reported. 
                              Initial measurements showed that the steam had corroded 
                              the affected section of pipe from its original thickness 
                              of 0.4 inches to 0.06 inches, less than one-third 
                              the minimum safety standard. Kansai Electric said 
                              in a statement that the pipe "showed large-scale 
                              corrosion."

                              Bush ..., in remarks he delivered on Sept. 15, 2003, 
                              to a cheering crowd of power-plant workers and executives 
                              in Monroe, Mich., about 35 miles south of Detroit. 
                              ...The Monroe plant, which is operated by Detroit 
                              Edison, is one of the nation's top polluters. Its 
                              coal-fired generators emit more mercury, a toxic 
                              chemical, than any other power plant in the state. 
                              Until recently, power plants like the one in Monroe 
                              were governed by N.S.R. regulations, which required 
                              the plant's owners to install new pollution-control 
                              devices if they made any significant improvements 
                              to the plant. Those regulations now exist in name 
                              only; they were effectively eliminated by a series 
                              of rule changes that the Bush administration made 
                              out of the public eye in 2002 and 2003. What the 
                              president was celebrating in Monroe was the effective 
                              end of new-source review. ...''The old regulations,'' 
                              he said, speaking in front of a huge American flag, 
                              ''undermined our goals for protecting the environment 
                              and growing the economy.'' New-source review just

                              new rules that will allow utility companies, like 
                              this one right here, to make routine repairs and 
                              upgrades without enormous costs and endless disputes,'' 
                              the president said. ''We simplified the rules. We 
                              made them easy to understand. We trust the people
