 Excerpt: BURLINGTON, Vt. — Vermont’s largest city has a new success to 
add to its list of socially conscious achievements: 100 percent of its 
electricity now comes from renewable sources such as wind, water and 
biomass. With little fanfare, the Burlington Electric Department crossed
 the threshold this month with the purchase of the 7.4-megawatt Winooski
 1 hydroelectric project on the Winooski River at the city’s edge. When 
it did, Burlington joined the Washington Electric Co-operative, which 
has about 11,000 customers across central and northern Vermont, which 
reached 100 percent earlier this year. “It shows that we’re able to do 
it, and we’re able to do it cost effectively in a way that makes 
Vermonters really positioned well for the future,” said Christopher 
Recchia, the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service. 
It’s part of a broader movement that includes a statewide goal of 
getting 90 percent of Vermont’s energy from renewable resources by 2050,
 including electricity, heating and transportation.  ...It’s also a 
growing movement across the country, as governments and businesses seek 
to liberate themselves from using power produced by environmentally 
harmful fossil fuels. ...Greensburg, Kansas, almost wiped out by a 2007 
tornado, rebuilt with energy efficiency in mind. A 12.5-megawatt wind 
farm went online in 2009, producing electricity in excess of that 
consumed by the community of 850, said Administrator Ed Truelove.... <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/in-vermont-a-milestone-in-green-energy-efforts/2014/09/14/9fc6e2c6-3c28-11e4-a430-b82a3e67b762_story.html" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/in-vermont-a-milestone-in-green-energy-efforts/2014/09/14/9fc6e2c6-3c28-11e4-a430-b82a3e67b762_story.html</a>.

 Excerpt: ...Of all the developed nations, few have pushed harder than 
Germany to find a solution to global warming. ...wind turbines, standing
 as far as 60 miles from the mainland, stretching as high as 60-story 
buildings and costing up to $30 million apiece. On some of these giant 
machines, a single blade roughly equals the wingspan of the largest 
airliner in the sky, the Airbus A380. By year’s end, scores of new 
turbines will be sending low-emission electricity to German cities 
hundreds of miles to the south. ...Germans will soon be getting 30 
percent of their power from renewable energy sources.  ...The word the 
Germans use for their plan is starting to make its way into 
conversations elsewhere: energiewende, the energy transition. ...“I am 
convinced that wind and sun will be the central sources of energy, not 
only in Germany but worldwide,” said Patrick Graichen, who heads a think
 tank in Berlin, Agora Energiewende, devoted to studying the shift.  
...One recent day, under a brilliant California sun, ...Lennar 
Corporation was putting solar panels on every house it built. The prices
 of the panels have plunged 70 percent in the past five years. That huge
 decline means solar power is starting to make more economic sense, 
especially in parts of the United States with high electricity prices. 
...The decline in the cost of renewable power spells potential trouble 
for companies that generate electricity. They make a lot of their money 
at times of day when demand for power, and therefore power prices, are 
high. Solar power, even a small amount, could be especially disruptive, 
shaving wholesale prices during those peak periods. ...some utilities, 
fearful of losing out as the power mix changes, have started attacking 
rules that encourage solar panels. Others are taking the opposite tack, 
jumping into the solar market themselves. ...In Germany, where solar 
panels supply 7 percent of power and wind turbines about 10 percent, 
wholesale power prices have crashed during what were once the most 
profitable times of day.... <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/science/earth/sun-and-wind-alter-german-landscape-leaving-utilities-behind.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/science/earth/sun-and-wind-alter-german-landscape-leaving-utilities-behind.html</a>.

...diesel is the single largest expense for the fishing industry and its
 biggest source of greenhouse gases. Not all fish have the same carbon 
finprint, however, and a new study reveals which ones take the most fuel
 to catch. Robert Parker, a Ph.D. student at the University of Tasmania,
 Hobart, in Australia, and Peter Tyedmers, an ecological economist at 
Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, analyzed more than 1600 records
 of fuel use by fishing fleets worldwide. They ... reported online this 
month in Fish and Fisheries. 7. Sardines: 71 liters ...Icelandic herring
 and Peruvian anchovies are the least fuel-intensive industrial 
fisheries known, caught with just 8 liters of fuel per ton of fish. 6. 
Skipjack tuna: 434 liters ...5. Scallops: 525 liters ...4. North 
American salmon: 886 liters ...3. Pacific albacore: 1612 liters ...2. 
Sole: 2827 liters ...1. Shrimp and lobster: 2923 liters ...How does wild
 seafood compare with other kinds of animal protein? The median fuel use
 in the fisheries is 639 liters per ton. In terms of climate impact, 
that’s equivalent to a bit more than 2 kilograms of carbon dioxide 
emitted for each kilogram of seafood landed. Chicken and farmed salmon 
and trout are roughly the same, but beef is significantly higher at 10 
kg of carbon dioxide per kg of live animal. “If you’re looking at having
 a green diet, you want to transition away from beef,” Parker says.... <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/07/what-seafood-guzzles-most-gas" target="_blank">http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/07/what-seafood-guzzles-most-gas</a>. by Erik Stokstad, Science.<br />

 Excerpt: ...David Polstein ...was unable to get a solar system to 
reduce his utility bill, he said, because his roof is too small and 
shady to make it worthwhile. Now, that could be changing. Mr. Polstein 
is considering joining a so-called community solar garden that is under 
development in his part of the state, one of many similar new 
arrangements now available in Massachusetts. Through the approach — 
largely pioneered in Colorado and spreading across the country — 
customers buy into a solar array constructed elsewhere and receive 
credit on their electricity bills for the power their panels produce. 
...Massachusetts passed its law enabling community renewable energy 
projects in 2008 and saw at least one town solar garden begin operating 
in Brewster in 2012. Now, Clean Energy Collective, a leading developer, 
is building systems that are due to start producing power in 
Massachusetts by the end of this month. The company has teamed with Next
 Step Living of Boston, a home energy-efficiency company, which is 
selling the product to consumers across Massachusetts. Several other 
places, including California, Minnesota and Washington, D.C., have laws 
to establish their programs, ...In New York, ...a bill is working its 
way through the State Legislature.... <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/business/energy-environment/buying-into-solar-power-no-roof-access-needed.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/business/energy-environment/buying-into-solar-power-no-roof-access-needed.html</a>.

 Excerpt: The 2014 Word Cup kicked off in Brazil this week and ... a 
bright spot in the construction is the integration of renewable energy. 
Complete with 6,000 solar panels, Mineirão is the first World Cup 
stadium ever powered by solar energy. The plant’s installed capacity of 
1,600 megawatts-hour per year (1.4 MW) is enough to power 1,200 
households, according to the Brazilian federal government’s World Cup 
website. “As it’s not possible to store all the energy, 10 percent of it
 will be used in powering the Mineirão and the rest will be transferred 
to consumers,” said Alexandre Maia Bueno with Minas Gerais State 
Electricity Company (CEMIG), which constructed the plant. ...One-third 
of the countries competing in the event have less solar energy than a 
single stadium in Brazil. “Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Cameroon, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Iran, Ivory Coast and Uruguay 
all produce less solar power than the 2.5 MW solar capability of the 
Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha in Brasilia. Ghana produces the same 
amount,” the report found. ...because Brazil will also play host to the 
2016 Olympic Games, solar is expected to factor in to those facilities, 
as well. <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/06/14/3449122/solar-powering-world-cup/" target="_blank">http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/06/14/3449122/solar-powering-world-cup/</a>  By Kiley Kroh, ThinkProgress.<br />

 Excerpt: KEWAUNEE, Wis. — Bryan T. Pagel, a dairy farmer, watched as a 
glistening slurry of cow manure disappeared down a culvert. If recycling
 the waste on his family’s farm would help to save the world, he was 
happy to go along. Out back, machinery was breaking down the manure and 
capturing a byproduct called methane, a potent greenhouse gas. A huge 
Caterpillar engine roared as it burned the methane to generate 
electricity, keeping it out of the atmosphere. The $3.2 million system 
also reduces odors at Pagel’s Ponderosa Dairy, one of the largest in 
Wisconsin, but it would not have been built without a surprising source 
of funds: a California initiative that is investing in carefully chosen 
projects, even ones far beyond its borders, to reduce emissions as part 
of the battle against climate change. California’s program is the latest
 incarnation of an increasingly popular — and much debated — mechanism 
that has emerged as one of the primary weapons against global warming. 
From China to Norway, Kazakhstan to the Northeastern United States, 
governments are requiring industries to buy permits allowing them to 
emit set levels of greenhouse gases. Under these plans, the allowable 
levels of pollution are steadily reduced and the cost of permits rises, 
creating an economic incentive for companies to cut emissions....  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/science/a-price-tag-on-carbon-as-a-climate-rescue-plan.html?ref=science" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/science/a-price-tag-on-carbon-as-a-climate-rescue-plan.html?ref=science</a>.

 Excerpt: Liquids containing a flowing network of nanoscale particles

 of using large amounts of solar and wind power. ...With some 
alternatives, it is difficult to get charge in and out of the materials;
 electricity is extracted only from the part of the materials that comes
 in direct contact with a flat metal plate. The nanoparticle network 
creates paths for electricity to flow throughout the liquid. This makes 
it possible, for example, to get from five to six times more energy out 
of an experimental type flow battery made of lithium and sulfur.  
Nanoparticles have long been used in conventional batteries with solid 
electrodes, but what distinguishes the new development is having a 
nanoparticle network form in a liquid, and maintain electrical 
connections even as that liquid flows. The U.S. Department of Energy 
estimates that for batteries to be economical, they need to cost less 
than $100 per kilowatt-hour, and need to last a decade or more. Such 
batteries cost hundreds of dollars per kilowatt-hour now. Chiang says it
 could be possible to build batteries that cost less than $100 per 
kilowatt-hour with the nanoparticle networks, but the researchers 
haven’t yet demonstrated that they can be recharged enough times to last
 a decade. <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/526811/nanoparticle-networks-promise-cheaper-batteries-for-storing-renewable-energy/">http://www.technologyreview.com/news/526811/nanoparticle-networks-promise-cheaper-batteries-for-storing-renewable-energy/</a>.

 Excerpt: ...Daniel Nocera...Harvard chemist has pioneered the 
artificial leaf, an invention that generates energy...based on 
photosynthesis. ...A vessel of water is exposed to light. A silicon 
strip coated in catalysts breaks down the water molecule such that on 
one side oxygen bubbles up, and, on the other, hydrogen, which can be 
used as a fuel.  ...The leaf and its technology have been replicated 
many times, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the University
 of Wisconsin and Free University Berlin... the issue isn’t the 
invention at all — it’s how to use it. “If I give you a canister of 
hydrogen that we got from the artificial leaf, you can’t use it right 
away,” Mr. Nocera said. ...Discovering a brilliant way to efficiently 
generate hydrogen is hard enough. Then there’s ... getting consumers 
accustomed to what’s needed for it to work, such as fuel cells — which 
convert hydrogen into usable electricity. ...You have to change an 
entire infrastructure.... If we had fuel cells in your house and your 
car, then everybody would be trying to implement the artificial leaf 
right now.” The other obstacle is the marketplace. Only a few years ago,
 he said, “the magic number was $3 ‘gas gallon equivalent.’ ” ...Even as
 he closed in on that number, the old fossil-fuel industry pulled the 
rug out from under him with a surge in cheap natural-gas extraction, 
driven by hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Seemingly overnight, the 
magic number became “a buck fifty,”....  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/technology/the-artificial-leaf-is-here-again.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/technology/the-artificial-leaf-is-here-again.html</a>. Jack Hitt, New York Times.<br />

 Excerpt: LIVERMORE, Calif. — Fusion, the process that powers the sun, 
is the forever dream of energy scientists — safe, nonpolluting and 
almost boundless. Even here at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 
where the primary focus of fusion work involves nuclear weapons, many 
scientists talk poetically about how it could end the world’s addiction 
to fossil fuels. “It’s the dream of the future, solving energy,” said 
Stephen E. Bodner, a retired physicist who worked on fusion at Livermore
 in the 1960s and ’70s.... The basic concept behind fusion is simple: 
Squeeze hydrogen atoms hard enough and they fuse together in helium. A 
helium atom weighs slightly less than the original hydrogen atoms, and 
by Einstein’s equation E = mc2, that liberated bit of mass turns into 
energy. Hydrogen is so abundant that unlike fossil fuels or fissionable 
material like uranium, it will never run out. ...Last month, a team 
headed by Omar A. Hurricane announced that it had used Livermore’s giant
 lasers to fuse hydrogen atoms and produce flashes of energy, like 
miniature hydrogen bombs. The amount of energy produced was tiny — the 
equivalent of what a 60-watt light bulb consumes in five minutes. But 
that was five times the output of attempts a couple of years ago.... <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/the-challenge-how-to-keep-fusion-going-long-enough.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/the-challenge-how-to-keep-fusion-going-long-enough.html</a>.

 Excerpt: ...demand for solar increased by 41% in 2013, with 4.75 
gigawatts of photovoltaic panels installed last year. (1 GW is about 
enough energy to power 750,000 homes.) That made solar the 
second-biggest source of new generation power in the U.S. after natural 
gas, which is still benefiting from the shale revolution. By the end of 
2013, there were more than 440,000 operating solar electric systems in 
the U.S., with more than 12 GW of photovoltaic (PV) and nearly 1 GW of 
concentrated solar power. ...While big utility scale plants like 
Ivanpah, which harnesses the heat of the sun with concentrated solar 
mirrors, got most of the headlines, it was small-scale residential 
systems that drove much of the demand last year. Residential projects 
increased by 60% over 2012 as the price of installing solar fell and as 
customers took advantage of leasing options—offered by companies like 
Solarcity, ...that allowed them to purchase panels with little money up 
front. ...“2013 offered the U.S. solar market the first real glimpse of 
its path toward mainstream status,” said Shayle Kann, vice president of 
GTM Research, which follows the clean tech market. ...Last year China 
installed at least 12 gigawatts of solar capacity, at least 50% more 
than any other country had ever built in a single year. ...The U.S. 
solar boom has been fueled in part by cheap solar panels from China, 
.... But those same cheap Chinese panels have hurt domestic 
manufacturers of solar PV, even as they’ve helped installers like 
Solarcity. Several domestic solar manufacturers...have complained that 
the Chinese government is unfairly subsidizing national solar PV 
manufacturers, which allows them to undercut their American competitors.
 In response, the U.S. government agreed in 2012 to impose tariffs of 24
 to 36% on Chinese PV panels. ...The U.S. solar industry is at a tipping
 point, poised to grow its way out of niche status and potentially 
change the way Americans think—and more importantly, pay for—energy.... <a href="http://time.com/12952/solar-energy-surges-concern-over-china/" target="_blank">http://time.com/12952/solar-energy-surges-concern-over-china/</a>. Bryan Walsh, Time.<br />

 Excerpt: NIPTON, Calif. — The Ivanpah solar power plant stretches over 
more than five square miles of the Mojave Desert. Almost 350,000 mirrors
 the size of garage doors tilt toward the sun [onto 2,200-ton boilers 
339 feet in the air to make steam that drives turbines to produce 
electricity] with an ability to energize 140,000 homes. The plant, which
 took almost four years and thousands of workers assembling millions of 
parts to complete, officially opened on Thursday, the first electric 
generator of its kind. It could also be the last. Since the project 
began, the price of rival technologies has plummeted, incentives have 
begun to disappear and the appetite among investors for mammoth solar 
farms has waned.  ...There’s other prospects for renewables and for 
solar that look a lot better than this particular solution,” he said, 
including rooftop solar systems that are being installed one by one on 
businesses and homes. ...The increase in renewable sources of energy, 
which produce intermittently, coming into the grid, has also increased 
the need for other services crucial to reliable operation, services that
 solar thermal plants could provide. Those needs include the ability to 
start and stop quickly, at any season or hour, when human operators give

 without disrupting their way of life. ...In Mongolia, often known as 
the land of the blue skies, the sun shines for 250 days on average each 
year. ... as of 2013, thanks to a concerted push by the Mongolian 
government, almost 70 percent of nomadic people have access to 
electricity. Bor, a herder who mainly travels around western Mongolia's 
Arkhangai province, is one of the people whose family benefits from 
portable solar home systems (SHS). "We use it for generating the power 
for lighting in the ger, charging phones, we can also generate a fridge 
to keep food longer and we can run a television. That is very useful for
 us because we can get the most recent weather forecast, which is 
important for our work and keeping our animals safe. Before we had power
 it was very difficult. Now it is almost like living in the city."

some nomads as a means of generating power, although they are still 
using stoves for heating, burning wood coal and dung throughout the

percent of the government’s energy portfolio by 2020. Federal facilities
 can install renewable energy projects or purchase electricity from

 Excerpt: It is an audacious undertaking with wide and deep support in 
Germany: shut down the nation’s nuclear power plants, wean the country 
from coal and promote a wholesale shift to renewable energy sources.  
But the plan, backed by Chancellor Angela Merkel and opposition parties 
alike, is running into problems in execution that are forcing Germans to
 come face to face with the costs and complexities of sticking to their 
principles. ...Ms. Merkel, of the traditionally conservative and 
pro-business Christian Democrats, came up with her plan in 2011, in the 
emotional aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. It 
envisions shutting down all of Germany’s nuclear plants by 2022 and 
shifting almost entirely to wind and solar power by 2050. ...The cost of
 the plan is expected to be about $735 billion, .... One of the first 
obstacles encountered involves the vagaries of electrical power 
generation that is dependent on sources as inconsistent and 
unpredictable as the wind and the sun. And no one has invented a means 
of storing that energy for very long, which means overwhelming gluts on 
some days and crippling shortages on others that require firing up old 
oil- and coal-burning power plants. That, in turn, undercuts the goal of
 reducing fossil-fuel emissions that have been linked to climate 
change.... <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/world/europe/germanys-effort-at-clean-energy-proves-complex.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/world/europe/germanys-effort-at-clean-energy-proves-complex.html</a>. By Melissa Eddy and Stanley Reed, New York Times.<br />

Scientific American that showed how the entire world could get all of 
its energy—fuel as well as electricity—from wind, water and solar 
sources by 2030. No coal or oil, no nuclear or natural gas. The tale 
sounded infeasible—except that Jacobson, from Stanford University, and 
Delucchi, from the University of California, Davis, calculated just how 
many hydroelectric dams, wave-energy systems, wind turbines, solar power
 plants and rooftop photovoltaic installations the world would need to 
run itself completely on renewable energy. ...Two weeks ago Jacobson and
 a larger team, including Delucchi, did it again. This time Jacobson 
showed in much finer detail how New York State’s residential, 
transportation, industrial, and heating and cooling sectors could all be

 decided to leverage the incessant Antelope Valley sun so that Lancaster
 could become the solar capital “of the world,” he said.  ...We want to 
be the first city that produces more electricity from solar energy than 
we consume on a daily basis,” he said. This means Lancaster’s rooftops, 
alfalfa fields and parking lots must be covered with solar panels to 
generate a total of 126 megawatts of solar power above the 39 megawatts 
already being generated and the 50 megawatts under construction. To that
 end, Lancaster just did what former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger failed 
to do in 2006: require that almost all new homes either come equipped 
with solar panels or be in subdivisions that produce one kilowatt of 
solar energy per house. ...the city tripled the number of residential 
installations in the past 18 months. ...While the desert sunshine in 
California and Arizona helped put those states atop the national solar 
energy rankings, towns in cloudier regions are also adopting it. 
Napoleon, Ohio, for instance, benefits from 14 megawatts of local solar 
power. But energy politics in Ohio and other Republican-run states are 
not solar friendly. ...embracing solar power is not just a matter of 
energy costs or reliability. It’s also about jobs. ...As Mayor Parris

the top arranger for renewable-energy stock offerings last year, is 
accelerating its funding efforts as it anticipates a rebound in an 
industry that’s slumped every year since 2009. …The investment bank is 
backing renewable energy that it expects will gain favor in a global 
shift it says is inevitable. That’s why short-term volatility will be 
trumped by long-term gains as emerging technologies first become 
commonplace and then become indispensable, according to Stuart 
Bernstein, the Goldman partner overseeing its renewables unit. …Goldman 
may boost its financing efforts this year as it seeks to meet a pledge 
made in May to invest and finance more than $40 billion in the industry 
in the next decade. Worldwide, more than $395 billion will be invested 
annually in renewable energy by 2020, he said….

 | Robert F. Service, Science: Vol. 339 no. 6115 p. 21.  Excerpt: 
…gallium arsenide (GaAs) … has been used for decades to make 
ultrahigh-efficiency solar cells for spacecraft. But the 
out-of-this-world cost of GaAs itself makes these too expensive for 
mass-market uses. Now, researchers at the University of Michigan may 
have found a way not only to drop the cost of producing GaAs cells, but 
also to drop the cost of the power they produce to near that of grid 
power from fossil fuels…. Crystals of GaAs are typically grown in 
200-millimeter-diameter cylinders that are then sliced into thin wafers.
 …But this tends to use too much of the expensive GaAs. More recently, 
groups … have used GaAs as a substrate on which to grow other 
semiconductor alloys … and recover the GaAs wafer so that it can be 
reused. Unfortunately, …it can only be used a few times before engineers
 must replace it with a fresh wafer. Three years ago, Stephen Forrest, a
 materials scientist at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, came up 
with a … strategy … to add two additional very chemically different 
layers to the sandwichlike stack of materials. … enabling it to be 
reused again and again. … additional steps also allowed them to bond the
 final GaAs layer to a clear plastic substrate, giving them a flexible 
solar cell with more than 22% efficiency. If cheap solar concentrators 
are added to focus more light onto the cell, Forrest says he believes 
that they should be able to convert more than 30% of the energy in 
sunlight into electricity. If that's the case, Forrest says his 
calculations show that they can reduce the cost of power from the cells 
to less than $1 per watt, roughly the current cost for silicon-based 
solar cells. If they can muster further improvements, that price could 
drop close to grid parity—the holy grail for solar power…. Read the full

 | By John Sullivan, Princeton University. Excerpt:  Princeton 
researchers have found a simple and economical way to nearly triple the 
efficiency of organic solar cells, the cheap and flexible plastic 
devices that many scientists believe could be the future of solar power.
 The researchers, led by electrical engineer Stephen Chou, were able to 
increase the efficiency of the solar cells 175 percent by using a 
nanostructured "sandwich" of metal and plastic that collects and traps 
light. …Chou… said the research team used nanotechnology to overcome two
 primary challenges that cause solar cells to lose energy: light 
reflecting from the cell, and the inability to fully capture light that 
enters the cell.  …The structure achieves even more efficiency for light
 that strikes the solar cell at large angles, which occurs on cloudy 
days or when the cell is not directly facing the sun. By capturing these
 angled rays, the new structure boosts efficiency by an additional 81 
percent, leading to the 175 percent total increase. …The researchers 
said the PlaCSH solar cells can be manufactured cost-effectively in 
wallpaper-size sheets. Chou's lab used "nanoimprint," a low-cost 
nanofabrication technique Chou invented 16 years ago, which embosses 
nanostructures over a large area, like printing a newspaper. …In 
addition to a direct boost to the cells' efficiency, the new 
nanostructured metal film also replaces the current ITO electrode that 
is the most expensive part of most current organic solar cells. "PlaCSH 
also is extremely bendable," Chou said. "The mechanical property of ITO 
is like glass; it is very brittle."…. Read the full article: <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/engineering/news/archive/?id=9141" target="_blank">http://www.princeton.edu/engineering/news/archive/?id=9141</a><br />

 | Allan Chen, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab News Center.  Excerpt:  
Berkeley, CA — The installed price of solar photovoltaic (PV) power 
systems in the United States fell substantially in 2011 and through the 
first half of 2012, according to the latest edition of Tracking the Sun,
 an annual PV cost-tracking report produced by the Department of 
Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). …median 
installed price of residential and commercial PV systems completed in 
2011 fell by roughly 11 to 14 percent from the year before, … in 
California, prices fell by an additional 3 to 7 percent within the first
 six months of 2012. These recent installed price reductions are 
attributable, in large part, to dramatic reductions in PV module prices,
 which have been falling precipitously since 2008. The report indicates 
that non-module costs—such as installation labor, marketing, overhead, 
inverters, and the balance of systems—have also fallen significantly 
over time.  … Ryan Wiser of Berkeley Lab’s Environmental Energy 
Technologies Division [said], “as these costs can be most readily 
influenced by local, state, and national policies aimed at accelerating 
deployment and removing market barriers.” …average non-module costs for 
residential and commercial systems declined by roughly 30 percent from 
1998 to 2011, but have not declined as rapidly as module prices in 
recent years. As a result, non-module costs now represent a sizable 
fraction of the installed price of PV systems, and continued deep 
reduction in the price of PV will require concerted emphasis on lowering
 the portion of non-module costs associated with so-called “business 
process” or “soft” costs. … the median installed price of PV systems 
installed in 2011 was $6.10 per watt (W) for residential and small 
commercial systems smaller than 10 kilowatts (kW) in size and was 
$4.90/W for larger commercial systems of 100 kW or more in size.  
Utility-sector PV systems larger than 2,000 kW in size averaged $3.40/W 
in 2011….

Technology of Austria, is building a 2.5-acre factory on a sugar 
plantation near Recife, Brazil, that will use genetically modified algae
 that can eat carbon dioxide from the sugar. Adding urea and some 
nutrients, the algae excrete ethanol. The path to profitability, 
according to the company, is raising the amount of algae produced per 
unit of area. Algae grows in ponds, but that turns out to require a lot 
of space: sunlight does not penetrate more than a couple of inches, so 
the ponds must have big surfaces. The problem is that the carbon dioxide
 injected to promote algae growth tends to escape from a big surface. 
SEE Algae’s solution is a silo that is 16 feet tall and has a volume of 
177 cubic feet. Sunlight is directed all over the inside of the silo by 
optical fiber technology. Because the light is coming from multiple 
directions, the hardware can produce algae at a density up to 20 times 
greater than can be generated on a pond.... <br />

 | by Thomas K. Grose, National Geographic News. Excerpt: This summer at
 the largest urban mall in Europe, visitors may notice something 
different at their feet. Twenty bright green rubber tiles will adorn one
 of the outdoor walkways at the Westfield Stratford City Mall, which 
abuts the new Olympic stadium in east London. …They are designed to 
collect the kinetic energy created by the estimated 40 million 
pedestrians who will use that walkway in a year, generating several 
hundred kilowatt-hours of electricity from their footsteps. That's 
enough to power half the mall's outdoor lighting. The slabs are produced
 by Pavegen Systems, a London startup launched in 2009 by Laurence 
Kemball-Cook, a fresh-faced, 26-year-old Londoner who developed his 
clean energy idea while earning a degree in industrial design and 
technology at Loughborough University. The 17.7-by-23.6-inch 
(45-by-60-centimeter) tiles are designed to be used wherever pedestrians
 congregate en masse: transportation hubs such as train, subway, and bus
 stations; airports; schools; malls; bustling shopping avenues. The 
power generated from millions of footfalls can be used to operate a 
range of low-power applications, including lighting, signs, digital ads,
 and Wi-Fi zones. …On average, one footstep generates 7 watts of 
electricity, though the amount varies depending on a person's weight. 
Each step pushes the rubber down a mere 5 millimeters, or a fraction of 
an inch.  …The tiles have also impressed Matthew Baxter, the head 
teacher (principal) at Langton Grammar—Kemball-Cook's alma mater—who 
said his 1,100 "boisterous boys" have truly put them to a punishing test
 over the past two years. "They've taken a pummeling, but they're fine."

Obama gave a shout-out to the technology that helped make this flight

plan to wean us from foreign petroleum while significantly reducing 
atmospheric carbon levels. This technology isn't in the blue-sky or even
 beta-testing stage of the R&amp;D sequence. It has already been proved 
in the lab, and it's now being proved in the marketplace, where some 
very big clients -- among them major airlines, the U.S. Navy, and Bunge,
 one of the world's largest agribusiness conglomerates -- are placing 
orders for millions of gallons of algae-derived biofuel from dozens of 
manufacturers…Algae-derived hydrocarbon has been something of a biofuel 
holy grail for decades now. Scientists have long known that the yucky 
green film commonly found covering ponds and poorly tended fish tanks 
can take two of the planet's easiest-to-find ingredients -- light and

connect to the electricity grid for backup. Environmental groups have 
issued a series of rebukes to Internet companies because of their heavy 
reliance on coal-fired power to run their centers…EBay plans to use 
about six million watts of power generated on-site by fuel cells, which 
are a substantially cleaner and more efficient source of energy than 
coal, in its new data center in South Jordan, Utah…Bloom Energy, a 
private company in Sunnyvale, Calif., will make the fuel cells. The new 
center will double the size of an existing data center there, which will
 still be on the grid. The grid will serve mainly as a backup power 
source for the new center. Even so, the fuel cells will account for less

California,…utilities not only lose valuable customers that help support
 the costs of the power grid but also have to pay them for the power 
they generate. Ultimately, the utilities say, the combination will lead 
to higher rate increases for everyone left on the traditional electric 
system. “Low-income customers can’t put on solar panels — let’s be 
blunt,” said David K. Owens, executive vice president of the Edison 
Electric Institute, which represents utilities. “So why should a 
low-income customer have their rates go up for the benefit of someone 
who puts on a solar panel and wants to be credited the retail rate?” The
 net metering benefit, which is available to residential and commercial 
customers with renewable energy systems in more than 40 states and has 
helped spur a boom in solar installations, is at the heart of a battle. 
Utilities, consumer advocates and renewable energy developers across the
 country are fighting over how much financial help to give to solar 
power and, to a lesser extent, other technologies. Regulators are in the
 middle, weighing the societal benefits of renewables as well as how 
best to spread the costs. Net metering has been so popular that several 
states are rapidly approaching regulatory limits on how many systems are
 eligible, meaning new customers have no assurance they can reap the 
same rewards. The solar industry, which is growing in size and 
influence, has been pressing to raise those limits to continue to 
encourage rooftop installations, while the utilities have generally been
 opposed….<br />

consideration to the vital role science and technology could play in 
addressing some of the planet's most pressing challenges. The 
"G-Science" statements recommend that governments engage the 
international research community in developing systematic, innovative 
solutions to three global dilemmas: how to simultaneously meet water and
 energy needs; how to build resilience to natural and technological 
disasters; and how to more accurately gauge countries' greenhouse gas 
emissions to verify progress toward national goals or international 
commitments... one of the G-Science statements says insufficient 
attention is being paid to the links between energy and water or, in 
other words, to the fact that energy requires water and water requires 
energy.  Without considering water and energy together, inefficiencies 
will occur, increasing shortages of both, the statement warns.  It 
recommends that policymakers recognize the direct interaction between 
water and energy by pursuing policies that integrate the two, and 
emphasize conservation and efficiency.  Regional and global cooperation 
will also be required....<br />

 | By James Holloway, ars technica. Excerpt: …Researchers at the 
University of California-Berkeley claim to have hit upon a 
counterintuitive means of boosting the efficiency of flatplate solar 
cells by making them emit light. "What we demonstrated is that the 
better a solar cell is at emitting photons, the higher its voltage and 
the greater the efficiency it can produce," said principal researcher, 
UC Berkeley Professor of Electrical Engineering Eli Yablonovitch. To 
briefly recap the mechanism behind the photovoltaic effect itself, 
photons from some external light source (the sun, preferably) entering a
 solar cell excite the electrons in the semiconductor into higher energy
 states. This frees them from confinement so that they can convey 
current. (The charge itself is created by using two materials. Free 
electrons find it easier to move in one direction between the materials,
 creating a negative charge in one and a positive charge in the other.) 
…In June, 2011, Alta Devices, a company cofounded by Yablonovitch, 
announced it had achieved an efficiency of 28.2 percent in its gallium 
arsenide-based solar panels (the previous record of 26.4 percent having 
been achieved in 2010). The boost of almost two percent may sound 
modest, but when closing in on the Shockley-Queisser limit, every tenth 
of a percent counts. The Shockley-Queisser limit is the theoretical 
maximum efficiency—33.7 percent—at which single p-n junction flatplate

 | By Matthew L. Wald, New York Times Green Blog.  Excerpt: There are at
 least a dozen major ways to turn sunlight into electricity, but one of 
the more interesting is using a field of mirrors to focus the sun’s 
energy on a “power tower” where the heat is captured and used later to 
spin a turbine and turn a generator… But now comes a new player with a 
different concept: build the tower, but on a smaller, simpler scale, and
 skip the storage in favor of using using biogas or natural gas to power
 the system after dark….<br />
…For solar, the big issue is the early evening: “Solar bows out at 5 
p.m., Mr. Rosenzweig noted. But that’s when peak demand begins — people 
come home, turn on the air conditioner full blast, put dinner in the 
oven or microwave and turn on television sets in the ensuing hours, he 
said. Rather than building a system with storage, which requires an 
oversize gathering system to take in more sun than is required for 
instant generation, Aora decided that it was easier to equip its system 
to burn natural gas, using most of the original hardware….  <br />

 University of Oregon Media Relations.  Excerpt:  Technology alone won't
 help the world turn away from fossil fuel-based energy sources, says 
University of Oregon sociologist Richard York. In a newly published 
paper, York argues for a shift in political and economic policies to 
embrace the concept that continued growth in energy consumption is not 
sustainable….<br />
…"In terms of governmental policies, we need to be thinking about social
 context, not just the technology," York said. "We need to be asking 
what political and economic factors are conducive to seeing real 
displacement. Just developing non-fossil fuel sources doesn't in itself 
tend to reduce fossil fuel use a lot — not enough. We need to be 
thinking about suppressing fossil fuel use rather than just coming up 
with alternatives alone."…<br />

 BOULDER CITY, Nev. …The president’s visits to Nevada and New Mexico on 
Wednesday opened a four-state trip over two days to highlight what he 
calls his “all of the above” agenda to foster alternative energy 
sources, as well as oil and gas, with federal tax and spending 
incentives. …Mr. Obama told a small audience at the nation’s largest 
solar energy installation, Sempra Energy’s Copper Mountain Solar 1 
Facility, which now provides power for 17,000 homes in California and is
 building additional acres of solar panels to create energy for 110,000 
more, according to the company …“The current members of the flat earth 
society in Congress, they would rather see us continue to provide $4 
billion — $4 billion — in tax subsidies, tax giveaways, to the oil 
companies,” Mr. Obama said. “Every time you fill up at the pump, they’re
 making money,” he added.<br />
Such language sets up a Senate vote, 
perhaps next week, on a Democratic proposal to repeal $2 billion in tax 
subsidies for the biggest oil companies and dedicate that sum to clean 
energy projects. But the measure is expected to fall short ….

Nuclear Power Plant, which caused some countries to reconsider nuclear 
power, uranium exploration is proceeding at a record pace in this part 
of the world….<br />
…The Inuit are split on the wisdom of large-scale uranium mining in 
their territory, with some saying their communities desperately need the
 economic development, while others are concerned about the 
environmental fallout from the industry. With a population of just 
30,000 mostly Inuit people living in a territory the size of Western 
Europe, Nunavut — which contains a sizeable part of mainland Canada as 
well as most of the country’s Arctic Archipelago, extending nearly to 
the North Pole — remains the largest undisturbed wilderness in the 
northern hemisphere. Though some mining roads exist, not a single road 
connects its 25 communities. As a result, some of the biggest caribou

country's largest "zero net energy" community, which means it is 
designed to generate as much energy as it consumes. Zero net energy has 
never been attempted on a scale the size of West Village. Anywhere. It 
is an experiment, a "living laboratory," as one campus official says. 
…When completed, the 130-acre site will be home to about 3,000 students,
 faculty and staff in 662 apartments and 343 single-family houses. …West
 Village is not some ivory tower utopian community. It is market-tested 
and supported — most of the $300 million needed to build the site came 
from San Francisco real estate developers Carmel Partners, which joined 
forces with Urban Villages of Denver on the project. ...The project 
broke ground in August 2009. …West Village will rely on two strategies 
to achieve the zero net goal — aggressive efficiency measures and 
on-site power generation. If built to current code, the completed 
portions of West Village would consume 22 million kilowatt hours of 
electricity a year. But by employing aggressive energy efficiency 
measures, planners project the annual total will come to about 11 
million kilowatt hours, a 50 percent reduction....<br />

company in Hillsboro, Ore., ClearEdge Power, announced a deal with an 
Austrian company, Güssing Renewable Energy, to supply 8.5 megawatts of 
fuel cells that would run on methane made from renewable sources. The 
companies said the 8.5 megawatts would be in place within three years, 
and the longer-term goal is 50 megawatts by 2020….<br />
...The company takes wood chips and crop wastes and gasifies them, which
 means that it zaps them into a fuel gas made of carbon monoxide and 
hydrogen. It then rearranges those molecules to make methane and carbon 
dioxide. The carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere, yes; but if 
the original source of the carbon was trees or crops, then regrowing 
those would mean that  the carbon dioxide would be reabsorbed from the 
atmosphere.  The company’s goal is to 
build carbon-neutral communities....<br />
…ClearEdge builds a five-kilowatt module that takes in natural gas and 
converts it to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. It then runs the hydrogen 
through a fuel cell to make electric current. It is about the size of a 
kitchen refrigerator….<br />
...The 8.5 megawatts will be met by 1,700 of the five-kilowatt units; 
some of them will stand alone while others will be grouped in office 
buildings, multifamily residential buildings and similar settings….<br />

eventually going to matter — that is, generate a significant portion of 
the nation’s electricity — the industry must overcome a major stumbling 
block... finding a way to store it for use when the sun isn’t shining. <br />
That challenge seems to be creating an opening for a different form of 
power, solar thermal, which makes electricity by using the sun’s heat to
 boil water. The water can be used to heat salt that stores the energy 
until later, when the sun dips and households power up their appliances 
and air-conditioning at peak demand hours in the summer....<br />
Two California companies are planning to deploy the storage 
technology... Together, the four projects will be capable of powering 
tens of thousand of households throughout a summer evening....<br />

 enough electricity to power the equivalent of up to 3.3 million modern 
American homes during daylight hours when the panels are at their most

Volume LXXIV, Number 2, Spring/Summer 2011.  Excerpt:   …John Dabiri… 
was studying how air flows around solid structures… trying to make wind 
turbines work efficiently amid the swirling gusts near buildings and 
skyscrapers, providing a source of renewable energy for cities. But as 
he played with the equations, he realized that they looked a lot like 
the ones that govern the flow of water through a school of swimming 
fish. …Nature is often quite the engineer, and—mathematically, at 
least—the fluid dynamics around swimming fish are more or less optimized
 for efficiency. Once he saw the connection between fish schools and 
wind turbines, it seemed natural to put them together. … if every 
currently existing wind turbine were churning out as much power as 
possible, the United States would have the capacity to generate some 40 
billion watts of wind power, which would account for 2 percent of the 
nation’s electricity. The maximum potential capacity of land-based wind 
power in the continental United States is estimated to be about 10 
trillion watts, or terawatts (TW). Building wind farms on every suitable
 patch of land in the world could provide 75 to 100 TW. Considering that
 global power consumption was about 15 TW in 2008, wind could—in 
principle—power the entire planet. …But one big problem with wind power 
is that conventional turbines—the ones that resemble huge propellers— 
need a lot of space. …Wind power is generally considered a mature 
technology. In theory, wind turbines can convert 60 percent of wind 
energy into electricity. In practice, the best are already at 50 
percent. …Dabiri’s fish-inspired wind farms use the lesser-known 
vertical-axis turbine, which looks a little like an eggbeater jutting 
out from the ground. When fish swim, they leave a horizontal row of 
regularly spaced vortices in their wakes; what would happen, he 
wondered, if he placed his downwind turbines in those vortices, and let 
them spin the turbines? …Individually, a vertical-axis turbine is less 
efficient than its monolithic cousin. But taken as a group, they can be 
positioned to squeeze as much power as possible from a given plot of 
land. Horizontal-axis turbines only capture the wind that blows through 
the circles swept by their blades, allowing precious energy to escape 
through the gaps between them. Vertical axis turbines, on the other 
hand, can be bunched together until they’re almost touching, harnessing 
the energy of almost all the air that blows by. …Vertical-axis turbines 
have other advantages. They’re safer for birds. And instead of being 
100-meter tall structures … vertical-axis turbines are around 10 meters 
tall. Because they’re quieter and smaller, they can be distributed more 
widely and can be built closer to population centers.... Read the full

 By Kris De Decker, Low-tech Magazine. Excerpt: Most of the talk about 
renewable energy is aimed at electricity production. However, most of 
the energy we need is heat, which solar panels and wind turbines cannot 
produce efficiently. To power industrial processes like the making of 
chemicals, the smelting of metals or the production of microchips, we 
need a renewable source of thermal energy. Direct use of solar energy 
can be the solution, and it creates the possibility to produce renewable
 energy plants using only renewable energy plants, paving the way for a 
truly sustainable industrial civilization. It is often assumed that our 
energy problems are solved when renewables reach 'grid parity' - the 
point at which they can generate electricity for the same price as 
fossil fuels. But to truly compete with fossil fuels, renewables must 
also reach 'thermal parity'…<br />
We tend to see solar energy as yet another way to generate electricity, 
using photovoltaic panels or solar thermal power plants. But solar 
energy can also be applied directly, without the intermediate step of 
generating electricity...<br />

 By Laura Wisland, Union of Concerned Scientists. Excerpt: …if you have 
ever used a magnifying glass to ignite a piece of paper, you have 
dabbled in a primitive form of concentrating solar power (CSP). CSP (or 
solar thermal) plants apply this principle on a much larger scale, 
creating intense heat to generate clean, carbon-free electricity…<br />
…The choice of CSP technology is often driven by location-specific 
factors, but steam-driven systems have benefited from the fact that they
 use the same turbines as conventional gas- and coal-fired power plants,
 allowing them to be deployed more quickly and at a lower cost than 
technologies that require fully customized parts. In addition, unlike 
some other renewable energy technologies, CSP systems that use trough or
 tower technology can store the heat they collect and use it to generate
 electricity when the sun is not shining. The heat is either stored as a
 hot liquid or transferred to another substance like molten salt or 
graphite... This thermal storage capability makes CSP more competitive 
with large coal and nuclear plants in terms of both output and 
reliability….<br />

and the Federal Aviation Administration, according to a member survey by
 the American Wind Energy Association. That is nearly as much as the 
amount of wind capacity that was actually built in the same year, the 
trade group says. <br />
...Part of the challenge is that many radar systems in use in the United
 States date back to the 1950s and have outdated processing capabilities
 — in some cases, less than those of a modern laptop computer. While 
there are technology fixes to ease interference on these aging systems, 
it can be tricky to filter out just the turbines. ...<br />

the mission of the new Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy, which
 is intended to finance high-risk, high-reward projects... ...The goal 
of this agency, whose budget is $400 million for two years, is to 
realize profound results — such as tens of millions of motor vehicles 
that would run 300 miles a day on electricity from clean sources or on 
liquid fuels from trees and garbage...<br />
...One miracle would be a better battery... ....A team at an infant

charge or discharge in two seconds, almost forever... ...That kind of 
battery is called a capacitor... ...a capacitor was the original 
battery... ...The walls of the tubes are about 12 atoms thick, and they 
grow, like leaves of grass, with just enough space between them to 
provide docking stations for charged particles. So a lot of charged 
particles can fit into a small space, with very light structures...

 By Elisabeth Rosenthal. The New York Times.Excerpt: …To force 
Portugal’s energy transition, [Prime Minister José] Sócrates’s 
government restructured and privatized former state energy utilities to 
create a grid better suited to renewable power sources. To lure private 
companies into Portugal’s new market, the government gave them contracts
 locking in a stable price for 15 years…<br />
Compared with the United States, European countries have powerful 
incentives to pursue renewable energy. Many, like Portugal, have little 
fossil fuel of their own, and the European Union’s emissions trading 
system discourages fossil fuel use by requiring industry to essentially 
pay for excessive carbon dioxide emissions.<br />
…Portugal is now on track to reach its goal of using domestically 
produced renewable energy, including large-scale hydropower, for 60 
percent of its electricity and 31 percent of its total energy needs by 
2020.<br />
…In making the shift, Portugal has overcome longstanding concerns about reliability and high cost.<br />
…Portugal’s national energy transmission company, Redes Energéticas 
Nacionais or R.E.N., uses sophisticated modeling to predict weather, 
especially wind patterns, and computer programs to calculate energy from
 the various renewable-energy plants. Since the country’s energy 
transition, the network has doubled the number of dispatchers who route 
energy to where it is needed. <br />
…A 2009 report commissioned by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change 
estimated that the United States would have to spend $3 billion to $4 
billion a year for the next two decades to create a grid that could 
accommodate deriving 20 percent of electricity from wind power by 
2030--a 40 percent to 50 percent increase over current spending.<br />

 By Allan Chen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Excerpt: …The 
U.S. was one of the fastest-growing wind power markets in the world in 
2009, second only to China, according to a report released today by the 
U.S. Department of Energy and prepared by Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory.<br />
…The 2009 edition of the “Wind Technologies Market Report” provides a 
comprehensive overview of developments in the rapidly evolving U.S. wind
 power market. The need for an annual report of this type has grown as 
the wind power industry has entered an era of unprecedented expansion, 
both globally and in the United States. … At the same time, as the 
report documents, the past year has been one of upheaval. The global 
financial crisis and lower wholesale electricity prices have negatively 
impacted the near-term growth prospects for the wind power industry, 
while new federal policies are pushing the industry towards continued 
aggressive expansion.<br />
… The report analyzes trends in wind power capacity growth, industry and
 manufacturing trends, turbine size, turbine prices, installed project 
costs, project performance, wind power prices, and how wind prices 
compare to the price of conventional generation. It also describes 
trends among developers, project owners, and wind power purchasers, and 
discusses financing issues. Finally, the report examines other factors 
impacting the domestic wind power market, including grid integration, 
transmission issues, and policy drivers. It concludes with a preview of 
possible near-term market developments.<br />
…Looking ahead, expectations are for a slower year in 2010. Lower 
expectations stem from a combination of the financial crisis, lower 
wholesale electricity prices, and lower demand for renewable energy. 
Projections among industry analysts range from 5,500 MW to 8,000 MW of 
wind power capacity likely to be installed in the United States in 2010,
 a drop of 20 to 45 percent compared to the nearly 10,000 MW installed 
in 2009. After a slower 2010, most predictions show market resurgence in
 2011 and 2012, as programs funded by the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act mature and as financing constraints ease. Beyond 2012, 
however, the picture is considerably less certain, because of the 
scheduled expiration of a number of federal policies at the end of that 
year.<br />

 By Matthew. L. Wald, The New York Times. Excerpt: …As the wind 
installations multiply, companies have found themselves dumping energy 
late at night, adjusting the blades so they do not catch the wind, 
because there is no demand for the power. And grid operators, accustomed
 to meeting demand by adjusting supplies, are now struggling to maintain
 stability as supplies fluctuate.<br />
On the cutting edge of a potential solution is Hawaii, where state 
officials want 70 percent of energy needs to be met by renewable sources
 like the wind, sun or biomass by 2030. A major problem is that it is 
impossible for generators on the islands to export surpluses to 
neighboring companies or to import power when the wind towers are 
becalmed.<br />
... So the 30-megawatt wind farm [on the north shore of Oahu], which 
will have enough power to run about 30 Super Wal-Marts, will have Xtreme
 Power of Austin, Tex., install a 15-megawatt battery <br />
…Computers will work to keep the battery exactly half-charged most hours
 of the day… If the wind suddenly gets stronger or falls off, the 
batteries will smooth out the flow so that the grid sees only a more 
gradual increase or decrease, no more than one megawatt per minute at 
some hours of the day.<br />
…The Hawaii installation is designed to succeed at a crucial but obscure
 function: frequency regulation. The alternating-current power system 
has to run at a strict 60 cycles per second, and the battery system can 
give and take power on a micro scale, changing directions from charge to
 discharge or vice versa within that 60th of a second, to keep the pace 
steady.<br />
…Electric companies are using other strategies for storage and frequency
 regulation. In Stephentown, N.Y., near Albany, a Massachusetts company,
 Beacon Power, is building a bank of 200 one-ton flywheels that will 
store energy from the grid on a moment-to-moment basis to keep the 
alternating current system at a strict 60 cycles… Atop each flywheel is a
 device that can be a motor at one moment and a generator the next, 
either taking energy and storing it in the flywheel or vice versa <br />
…The Energy Department is also supporting storage projects that rely on compressed air.<br />

Appalachian valley called Pigeonroost Hollow, a step that could be a 
turning point for one of the country’s most contentious environmental 
disputes.<br />
…The Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama administration, in a
 break with President George W. Bush’s more coal-friendly approach, has 
threatened to halt or sharply scale back the project known as Spruce 1. 
The agency asserts that the project would irrevocably damage streams and
 wildlife and violate the Clean Water Act.<br />
…Feelings run high in the counties right around the project area. 
“Spruce 1 is extremely important to all of southern West Virginia 
because if this permit is pulled back, every mine site is going to be 
vulnerable to having its permits pulled,” said James Milan, manager of 
Walker Machinery in Logan, which sells gargantuan Caterpillar equipment…
 The loss of jobs, Mr. Milan said, would have devastating effects on 
struggling communities.<br />
…In documents issued in March, the E.P.A. said the project as approved 
would still smother seven miles of streamed… Filling in headwaters 
damages the web of life downstream, from aquatic insects to salamanders 
to fish, and temporary channels and rebuilt streams are no substitute, 
the agency said. The pulverized rock can release toxic levels of 
selenium and other pollutants, it noted...<br />

breakdown of civil order. Her call was part of a telephone course about 
how to live through it all. <br />
…“Our whole economy depends on greater and greater energy supplies, and

 by Elisabeth Rosenthal, New York Times. Excerpt: PUERTOLLANO, Spain — 
...Armed with generous incentives from the Spanish government to 
jump-start a national solar energy industry, the city set out to replace
 its failing coal economy by attracting solar companies, with a campaign
 slogan: “The Sun Moves Us.” Soon, Puertollano, home to the Museum of 
the Mining Industry, had two enormous solar power plants, factories 
making solar panels and silicon wafers, and clean energy research 
institutes. Half the solar power installed globally in 2008 was 
installed in Spain. Farmers sold land for solar plants. Boutiques 
opened. And people from all over the world, seeing business 
opportunities, moved to the city, which had suffered from 20 percent 
unemployment and a population exodus. But as low-quality, poorly 
designed solar plants sprang up on Spain’s plateaus, Spanish officials 
came to realize that they would have to subsidize many of them 
indefinitely, and that the industry they had created might never produce
 efficient green energy on its own. <br />
In September the government abruptly changed course, cutting payments 
and capping solar construction. Puertollano’s brief boom turned bust. 
Factories and stores shut, thousands of workers lost jobs, foreign 
companies and banks abandoned contracts that had already been 
negotiated.<br />
...Yet, despite the pain that Spain’s incentives ended up causing, in 
many ways they fulfilled their promise, Ms. DeLine said. “Even though 
incentives can create bubbles and bursts, without them this industry 
won’t take off,” she said....<br />
The most robust Spanish solar companies survived the downturn, have restructured and are re-emerging as global players.....<br />
...When it was announced in the summer of 2007, Spain’s premium payment 
for solar power was the most generous anywhere — 58 cents per 
kilowatt-hour — with few strings attached. In retrospect it was far too 
high. <br />
...Although Spain’s long-term goal had been to produce 400 megawatts of 
electricity from solar panels by 2010, it reached that milestone by the 
end of 2007.<br />
In 2008 the nation connected 2.5 gigawatts of solar power into its grid,
 more than quintupling its previous capacity and making it second to 
Germany, the world leader. But many of the hastily opened plants offered
 no hope of being cost-competitive with conventional power, being poorly
 designed or located where sunshine was inadequate, for example.<br />
...In Spain, the tariff, now adjusted quarterly, is about 39 cents per 
kilowatt-hour for electricity from freestanding solar power plants, and 
slightly higher for panels on rooftops.<br />
Germany’s tariff, 53 cents per kilowatt-hour, is expected to fall at 
least 15 percent this summer, and there are proposals before Parliament 
to eliminate subsidies for solar plants on farmland....<br />

 By Jason Palmer, BBC News. Excerpt: A major hurdle to producing fusion 
energy using lasers has been swept aside, results in a new report show.<br />
The controlled fusion of atoms - creating conditions like those in our 
Sun - has long been touted as a possible revolutionary energy source. 
However, there have been doubts about the use of powerful lasers for 
fusion energy because the "plasma" they create could interrupt the 
fusion. An article in Science showed the plasma is far less of a problem
 than expected.<br />
The report is based on the first experiments from the National Ignition 
Facility (Nif) in the US that used all 192 of its laser beams.<br />
..."For the first time ever in the 50-year journey of laser fusion, 
these laser-plasma interactions have been shown to be less of a problem 
than predicted, not more," said Mike Dunne, director of the UK's Central
 Laser Facility and leader of the European laser fusion effort known as 
HiPER.<br />
"I can't overstate how dramatic a step that is," he told BBC News. "Many
 people a year ago were saying the project would be dead by now."<br />
Adding momentum to the ignition quest, Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory announced on Wednesday that, since the Science results were 
first obtained, the pulse energy record had been smashed again. They now
 report an energy of one megajoule on target - 50% higher than the 
amount reported in Science.<br />
The current calculations show that about 1.2 megajoules of energy will 
be enough for ignition, and currently Nif can run as high as 1.8 
megajoules....<br />

Big wind farms sprawl across our hills. Big solar power plants will soon
 blanket acres of desert. Big new power lines will bring that 
electricity to our cities.<br />
This, Bill Powers insists, is exactly the wrong approach. He wants us to think small.<br />
Powers, an engineer and energy consultant, argues that California should
 cover every available rooftop with photovoltaic solar panels, 
especially commercial buildings. The panels can be installed quickly, 
unlike large solar power plants that take years to win government 
permits. They don't require big new power lines. And their price has 
dropped about 40 percent in the past year.<br />
... "The solar plants in the desert are albatrosses," Powers said. 
"We've come to a point where (photovoltaic solar) is either going to be 
in the remote installations or it's going to be in the urban core. It'll
 be much more beneficial for those solar panels to be sitting in the 
urban core where they're going to be used."<br />
...Photovoltaic solar "in the urban core is a fundamental threat to the utility business model," Powers said.<br />
..."Because of the economic and operational issues, I think we're going 
to see large-scale, grid-connected power for a long, long time," said 
Jonathan Marshall, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Many 
environmentalists reluctantly agree.<br />
...California has been trying to ramp up its use of renewable power as a
 way to combat global warming. Under state law, 20 percent of the 
electricity the utilities sell must come from renewable sources by the 
end of 2010, a deadline they will probably miss.<br />
...Photovoltaic solar panels have dropped in price, but the technology 
remains more expensive than many other ways to generate electricity, 
according to the California Energy Commission. All figures are given in 
cents per kilowatt hour and include construction and operation costs.<br />

 By Abby Goodnough, The NY Times. Two Massachusetts Indian tribes have 
objected to the Cape Wind project, saying it would block their unimpeded
 view of the sunrise.<br />
Excerpt: BOSTON - In a new setback for a controversial wind farm 
proposed off Cape Cod, the National Park Service announced Monday that 
Nantucket Sound was eligible for listing on the National Register of 
Historic Places, guaranteeing further delays for the project.<br />
Known as Cape Wind, the project is the nation's first planned offshore 
wind farm and would cover 24 square miles in the sound, an area roughly 
the size of Manhattan. The park service decision came in response to a 
request from two Massachusetts Indian tribes, who said the 130 proposed 
wind turbines would thwart their spiritual ritual of greeting the 
sunrise, which requires unobstructed views across the sound, and disturb
 ancestral burial grounds.<br />
...The decision by the National Park Service did not kill the Cape Wind 
plan, but it erected new hurdles by requiring more negotiations and, 
possibly, changes to the project, like moving it.<br />
...Cedric Cromwell, chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, said the 
decision confirmed "what the Wampanoag people have known for thousands 
of years: that Nantucket Sound has significant archaeological, historic 
and cultural values and is sacred to our people."<br />
Others said the finding was surprising because Nantucket Sound, which 
encompasses more than 500 square miles, is by far the largest body of 
water ever found eligible for listing on the national historic register.
 Other eligible bodies of water have included Walden Pond in 
Massachusetts, which covers about 60 acres, and Zuni Salt Lake in New 
Mexico, which is about 6,500 feet across, said Jeffrey Olson, a 
spokesman for the park service.<br />
"The decision is without precedent in terms of implicating many square 
miles of what is, legally speaking, the high seas," said Ian A. Bowles, 
the Massachusetts secretary of energy and environmental affairs. "But as
 a procedural matter, it's a good thing a decision was reached, and the 
secretary is getting personally involved to get it over the finish 
line."<br />
A spokeswoman for Mr. Salazar said he planned to meet next week with 
representatives of the tribes and the developer in hopes of speeding a 
resolution.<br />

 Excerpt: The ocean is a potentially vast source of electric power, yet 
as engineers test new technologies for capturing it, the devices are 
plagued by battering storms, limited efficiency, and the need to be 
tethered to the seafloor.<br />
Now, a team of aerospace engineers is applying the principles that keep 
airplanes aloft to create a new wave-energy system that is durable, 
extremely efficient, and can be placed anywhere in the ocean, regardless
 of depth.<br />
While still in early design stages, computer and scale-model tests of 
the system suggest higher efficiencies than wind turbines. The system is
 designed to effectively cancel incoming waves, capturing their energy 
while flattening them out, providing an added application as a 
storm-wave breaker.<br />
A colleague had read an article on wave energy in a magazine and 
mentioned it to Siegel and the other team members, and they realized 
they could operate a wave energy device using the same feedback control 
concepts they had been developing....<br />

 BY Louis Bergeron, Stanford Report. Excerpt: Most of the technology 
needed to shift the world from fossil fuel to clean, renewable energy 
already exists. Implementing that technology requires overcoming 
obstacles in planning and politics, but doing so could result in a 30 
percent decrease in global power demand, say Stanford civil and 
environmental engineering Professor Mark Z. Jacobson and University of 
California-Davis researcher Mark Delucchi.<br />
...Jacobson and Delucchi used data from the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration to project that if the world's current mix of energy 
sources is maintained, global energy demand at any given moment in 2030 
would be 16.9 terawatts, or 16.9 million megawatts.<br />
They then calculated that if no combustion of fossil fuel or biomass 
were used to generate energy, and virtually everything was powered by 
electricity – either for direct use or hydrogen production – the demand 
would be only 11.5 terawatts. That's only two-thirds of the energy that 
would be needed if fossil fuels were still in the mix.<br />
In order to convert to wind, water and solar, the world would have to 
build wind turbines; solar photovoltaic and concentrated solar arrays; 
and geothermal, tidal, wave and hydroelectric power sources to generate 
the electricity, as well as transmission lines to carry it to the users,
 but the long-run net savings would more than equal the costs, according
 to Jacobson and Delucchi's analysis.<br />
"If you make this transition to renewables and electricity, then you 
eliminate the need for 13,000 new or existing coal plants," Jacobson 
said. "Just by changing our infrastructure we have less power 
demand."...<br />

days a year -- to serve the needs of some 99 percent of its urban 
households. Solar water heaters first caught on in China in the 1980s, 
when cities began to mushroom and people started moving out of housing 
provided by their work units, buying new homes, and investing in 
household appliances. At a couple hundred dollars each, the solar 
heaters pay for themselves in a few years with savings on energy bills. 
...The strength of the program lies in "leapfrogging" -- not developing 
first and cleaning up afterward, as happened with the industrial 
revolution in the West, but getting people hooked on solar energy as an 
integral part of the development process. "There are lots of 
opportunities [in China] because of rapid growth," explains Xuemei Bai, 
an expert on climate and urban design at the Commonwealth Scientific and
 Industrial Research Organization, Australia's national science agency. 
"You don't have to retrofit existing buildings." ...In 2008 it vowed to 
go carbon neutral, becoming one of the first four cities to join the 
United Nations Environment Program's Climate Neutral Network (the other 
three cities are in Norway, Sweden, and Canada)....<br />

2009 May 28. <a href="http://www.onearth.org/article/hard-hats-swarm-to-smart-energy">Hard Hats Swarm to Smart Energy</a>.
 By Liz Galst, NRDC OnEarth. Excerpt: On an early spring morning in a 
classroom in New York City's hardscrabble East Harlem neighborhood, a 
group of four dozen young adults listens intently to a presentation by 
Elizabeth Yeampierre, president of the New York City Environmental 
Justice Alliance.<br />
... Brandon Ingram, a Bronx native sitting in the front row, rises. He 
wears the lozenge-shaped glasses of a budding hipster and holds aloft 
Van Jones's best-selling 2008 book, The Green Collar Economy.<br />
"I've been reading this," Ingram says, displaying the cover for all to 
see. "I want everyone in the room to hear it." He reads aloud a passage 
that spells out a bright green future for job seekers: in 2006, there 
were 8.5 million jobs (and by the end of 2007, half a million new ones) 
in renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies, and the sector 
produced nearly $1 trillion in revenue and more than $100 billion in 
industry profits.<br />
Ingram's colleagues are equally impressed. They are classmates in a 
12-week green-construction training program run by Strive, a nonprofit 
group based in New York City. For many of them, long unemployed, work in
 the expanding green sector could be the break they've been waiting for.
 The program teaches both "hard" and "soft" job skills. At the practical
 level, students learn how to audit and then insulate a leaky house and 
construct new, energy-efficient buildings. They also learn the basics of
 public speaking and personal presentation -- hence all the snazzy ties 
in the room....<br />
Job training programs like Strive, offering skills in everything from 
energy-efficiency retrofitting to the manufacture and maintenance of 
wind turbines, are springing up across the country. Together they 
represent a significant shift in the American workforce and, perhaps, in
 the environmental movement. President Barack Obama's $787 billion 
federal stimulus package promises at least $1 billion for green-job 
training; millions more are being invested by foundations, state and 
local governments, and private interests....<br />
The idea that blue-collar occupations -- make that "green-collar" 
occupations -- can help heal the earth while providing stable, 
well-paying employment was once simply a fantasy of a few underfunded 
dreamers. But in 2003 that fantasy came to life through the work of two 
pioneering nonprofits: <a href="http://www.ssbx.org/">Sustainable South Bronx</a>, in New York City, and Baltimore's <a href="http://www.civicworks.com/">Civic Works</a>.
 Now green-job training programs serve a broad spectrum of the 
population and attract a scale of financial backing that surprises even 
some of their earliest advocates....<br />

2009 May 26. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/science/26fusi.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science">In Hot Pursuit of Fusion (or Folly)</a>.
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD, NY Times. Excerpt: LIVERMORE, Calif. ..."Bringing 
Star Power to Earth" reads a giant banner that was recently unfurled 
across a building the size of a football stadium.<br />
The $3.5 billion site is known as the National Ignition Facility, or 
NIF. For more than half a century, physicists have dreamed of creating 
tiny stars that would inaugurate an era of bold science and cheap 
energy....<br />
In theory, the facility's 192 lasers - made of nearly 60 miles of 
mirrors and fiber optics, crystals and light amplifiers - will fire as 
one to pulverize a fleck of hydrogen fuel smaller than a match head. 
Compressed and heated to temperatures hotter than those of the core of a
 star, the hydrogen atoms will fuse into helium, releasing bursts of 
thermonuclear energy.<br />
The project's director, Ed Moses, said that getting to the cusp of 
ignition (defined as the successful achievement of fusion) had taken 
some 7,000 workers and 3,000 contractors a dozen years, their labors 
creating a precision colossus of millions of parts and 60,000 points of 
control, 30 times as many as on the space shuttle.<br />
...In February, NIF fired its 192 beams into its target chamber for the 
first time.... skeptics dismiss NIF as a colossal delusion that is 
squandering precious resources at a time of economic hardship. Just 
operating it ... will cost $140 million a year. Some doubters ridicule 
it as the National Almost Ignition Facility, or NAIF....<br />
Dr. Moses, while offering no guarantees, argued that any great endeavor 
involved risks and that the gamble was worth it because of the potential
 rewards.<br />
He said that NIF, if successful, would help keep the nation's nuclear 
arms reliable without underground testing, would reveal the hidden life 
of stars and would prepare the way for radically new kinds of power 
plants.<br />
"If fusion energy works," he said, "you'll have, for all intents and 
purposes, a limitless supply of carbon-free energy that's not 
geopolitically sensitive. What more would you want? It's a game 
changer."....<br />

2009 May 7. <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17090-sea-snake-generates-electricity-with-every-wave.html">Sea 'snake' generates electricity with every wave</a>.
 By Colin Barras, NewScientist. Excerpt: Anaconda, a giant rubber 
"snake" that floats offshore and converts wave energy to electricity, is
 a step closer to commercialisation. An 8-metre long, 1/25th scale 
version is currently undergoing tests in a large wave tank in Gosport, 
UK, and a full-size working version could be a reality in five years.<br />
Harnessing the power of waves is an attractive proposition because they 
are much more energy dense than wind. But wave power remains the poor 
relation of the renewable energy sector due to the difficulties of 
cheaply operating machinery in the harsh marine environment. The world's
 first commercial wave farm only began operating last year, off the 
northern coast of Portugal.<br />
A variety of other designs are in testing around the world, but none are
 as unusual as the Anaconda. The rubber snake is filled with freshwater –
 to help deter sea creatures from setting up a home inside – and sealed 
at both ends to create a semi-rigid balloon that floats at the sea's 
surface.<br />
The tube is anchored at one end and as waves wash along its length they 
exert pressure on the snake that is transmitted by the water inside. 
This forces Anaconda's walls to expand outwards into the wave troughs 
where they are under less pressure, forming "bulge waves" that travel 
along the Anaconda's length.<br />
These waves are similar to those that pass through the human circulatory
 system and can be felt as the pulse in the wrist and neck, says Rod 
Rainey of Atkins Global, co-inventor of the Anaconda. When each bulge 
wave reaches the end of the snake it keeps a turbine spinning to 
generate electricity....<br />

2009 March/April. <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0903.blake.html">The Rooftop Revolution</a>.
 By Mariah Blake, Washington Monthly. Excerpt: A little-known policy is 
turning sleepy central Florida into a green energy hub. Could it do the 
same for America at large? This winter, as Congress was scrambling to 
pass the stimulus package, the bottom fell out of the renewable energy 
sector.... Trade groups like the American Wind Energy Association, which
 as recently as December was forecasting "another record-shattering year
 of growth," began predicting that new installations would plunge by 30 
to 50 percent. Solar panel manufacturers that had been blazing a trail 
of growth announced a wave of layoffs....<br />
But there is one place where capital is still flowing: Gainesville, 
Florida. ...Tim Morgan ... intends to rent roof space from eighty 
Gainesville businesses and install twenty-five-kilowatt solar generating
 systems on each of them, for a total of two megawatts-a project that 
would nearly double Florida's solar-generating capacity. ...Paradigm 
Properties, a residential real estate company, plans to install 
photovoltaic arrays on fifty local apartment buildings and its downtown 
headquarters. Achira Wood, a custom carpentry outlet, is plastering the 
roof of its workshop-roughly 50,000 square feet of galvanized steel-with
 solar panels. Interstate Mini Storage is doing the same with its 
sprawling flat-roofed compound. Tom Lane, who owns ECS Solar Energy 
Systems, a local solar contractor, told me he's planning to expand his 
staff from eleven to at least fifty. "The activity we've seen is just 
explosive," he said. "I've been in the business thirty years and I've 
never seen anything like it."<br />
Why is the renewable energy market in Gainesville booming while it's 
collapsing elsewhere in the country? The answer boils down to policy. In
 early February, the city became the first in the nation to adopt a 
"feed-in tariff"-a clunky and un-descriptive name for a bold incentive 
to foster renewable energy. Under this system, the local power company 
is required to buy renewable energy from independent producers, no 
matter how small, at rates slightly higher than the average cost of 
production. This means anyone with a cluster of solar cells on their 
roof can sell the power they produce at a profit. The costs of the 
program are passed on to ratepayers, who see a small rise in their 
electric bills (in Gainesville the annual increase is capped at 1 
percent). While rate hikes are seldom popular, the community has rallied
 behind this policy, because unlike big power plant construction-the 
costs of which are also passed on to the public-everyone has the 
opportunity to profit, either by investing themselves or by tapping into
 the groundswell of economic activity the incentive creates....<br />

2009 March 11. <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2009/20090311_sunshade.html">Atmospheric ‘Sunshade’ Could Reduce Solar Power Generation</a>.
 NOAA. Excerpt: The concept of delaying global warming by adding 
particles into the upper atmosphere to cool the climate could 
unintentionally reduce peak electricity generated by large solar power 
plants by as much as one-fifth, according to a new NOAA study....<br />
“Injecting particles into the stratosphere could have unintended 
consequences for one alternative energy source expected to play a role 
in the transition away from fossil fuels,” said author Daniel Murphy, a 
scientist at NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colo.<br />
The Earth is heating up as fossil-fuel burning produces carbon dioxide, 
the primary heat-trapping gas responsible for man-made climate change. 
To counteract the effect, some geoengineering proposals are designed to 
slow global warming by shading the Earth from sunlight.<br />
...Murphy found that particles in the stratosphere reduce the amount and
 change the nature of the sunlight that strikes the Earth. Though a 
fraction of the incoming sunlight bounces back to space (the cooling 
effect), a much larger amount becomes diffuse, or scattered, light.<br />
On average, for every watt of sunlight the particles reflect away from 
the Earth, another three watts of direct sunlight are converted to 
diffuse sunlight. Large power-generating solar plants that concentrate 
sunlight for maximum efficiency depend solely on direct sunlight and 
cannot use diffuse light....<br />
<br />
2009 Feb 27. <a href="http://www.onearth.org/article/selling-the-sun">Selling the Sun</a>.
 by Michael Behar, OnEarth magazine - NRDC. A Man, A Plan, and the Dawn 
of America's Solar Future. "I am a capitalist," announces Jigar Shah, 
the 34-year-old founder of SunEdison. ...An iconoclast among greens, 
he's a devoted environmentalist who champions market economics and 
believes American business acumen can conquer climate change. Shah has 
spent the past six years leveraging his convictions to build North 
America's largest and most successful provider of solar energy.<br />
In 2003, Shah launched SunEdison to smash the decades-old paradigm that 
required anyone wanting solar to pay huge installation costs up front. 
Depending on its size, a rooftop array or a ground-based solar farm can 
cost anywhere from $10,000 to $10 million. This infuriated Shah, who has
 always believed that having to own the means of producing solar power 
is woefully out of step with how the energy industry operates. "Do you 
want to be in the power-plant business?" he asks. "Or do you just want 
to buy solar power?" Imagine having to own and operate a satellite to 
get DirecTV and you begin to understand why Shah scorned the prevailing 
model for solar energy.<br />
...For Shah's part, he didn't invent any groundbreaking technologies. He
 just repackaged ones that already existed and convinced people to buy 
them. SunEdison customers pay nothing for their solar systems. That's 
right, zero. Instead they sign what is known as a power-purchasing 
agreement, or PPA. These agreements are commonplace in the coal, oil, 
nuclear, and natural gas industries (the Hoover Dam was financed in part
 with PPAs). But Shah figured out how to make PPAs profitable for solar,
 something that nobody had been able to do before. When SunEdison 
installs a solar array, the customer agrees under a PPA to buy the 
electricity it produces at a set price for at least 10 years. "When we 
priced out owning the system ourselves, it didn't make sense," Buckley 
tells me. "We wanted a way to establish price certainty in a volatile 
market. SunEdison gave us a long-term hedge against that price 
uncertainty. We're paying less for electricity and reducing our carbon 
impact. And 15 years down the road, when the price of electricity is 
higher, the savings will be even more attractive."....<br />

 By Elisabeth Rosenthal, The New York Times.Excerpt: ABU DHABI, United 
Arab Emirates — With one of the highest per capita carbon footprints in 
the world, these oil-rich emirates would seem an unlikely place for a 
green revolution.<br />
...Still, the region’s leaders know energy and money, having built their
 wealth on oil. They understand that oil is a finite resource, 
vulnerable to competition from new energy sources.<br />
So even as President-elect Barack Obama talks about promoting green jobs
 as America’s route out of recession, gulf states, including the 
emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, are making a concerted push to become 
the Silicon Valley of alternative energy.<br />
They are aggressively pouring billions of dollars made in the oil fields
 into new green technologies. They are establishing billion-dollar 
clean-technology investment funds. And they are putting millions of 
dollars behind research projects at universities from California to 
Boston to London, and setting up green research parks at home.<br />
...This new investment aims to maintain the gulf’s dominant position as a
 global energy supplier, gaining patents from the new technologies and 
promoting green manufacturing. But if the United States and the European
 Union have set energy independence from the gulf states as a goal of 
new renewable energy efforts, they may find they are arriving late at 
the party.<br />
“The leadership in these breakthrough technologies is a title the U.S. 
can lose easily,” said Peter Barker-Homek, chief executive of Taqa, Abu 
Dhabi’s national energy company. “Here we have low taxes, a young 
population, accessibility to the world, abundant natural resources and 
willingness to invest in the seed capital.”<br />
...For the rest of the world, the enormous cash infusion may provide the
 important boost experts say is needed to get dozens of emerging 
technologies — like carbon capture, microsolar and low-carbon aluminum —
 over the development hump to make them cost-effective....<br />
