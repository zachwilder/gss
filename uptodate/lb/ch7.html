Source: By Annie Roth, The New York Times. Excerpt: North Atlantic right whales are struggling to survive, and it shows. Most of the 360 or so North Atlantic right whales alive today bear scars from entanglements in fishing gear and collisions with speeding ships and, according to a new study, they are much smaller than they should be. Scientists recently examined how the size-to-age ratios of right whales living in the North Atlantic have changed over the past 40 years and found that the imperiled whales are significantly smaller than earlier generations of their species. Their research, </span><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00614-X" rel="nofollow">published</a><span style="font-size:large"> Thursday in the journal Current Biology, suggests that human-induced stressors, primarily entanglements, are stunting the growth of North Atlantic right whales, reducing their chances of reproductive success and increasing their chances of dying.

By Priyanka Runwal, The New York Times. Excerpt: Scientists are concerned about unregulated feeding of ocean wildlife by tour operators. ...Before the pandemic, ...boats would flock to Bottom Harbor and tourists would hop into its shallow turquoise waters holding squid morsels in their hands or on wooden skewers. The turtles would then grab the snacks as the visitors snapped Instagram-worthy images. ...The practice is known as provisioning, and it’s an easy meal for the shelled creatures. But conservation biologists have expressed concern in a number of recent published scientific studies about what this food source means for the physical well-being and natural behavior of not just these turtles, but other marine creatures, from tiny reef fish to giant sharks. ...“Suddenly a very independent and solitary animal is in close contact with everybody else, which means it’s easier for them to get infected with parasites or viruses,” said Valeria Senigaglia, a marine biologist at Australia’s Murdoch University. It also encourages wild animals to eat regularly rather than intermittently, and sometimes discourages tracking and hunting of prey. Habituation, aggression and loss of fear toward humans typically follows, which could endanger the animals....

Excerpt: Scientists have studied whale calls for decades to learn more about the communication and migration of these oceanic giants. Now, they’ve found a new use for the vocalizations: creating an “ultrasound” of the ocean floor. The strategy, reported today in Science, could help reveal details about Earth’s crust and earthquakes without disturbing sensitive marine life. ... fin whale vocalizations, which are among the strongest animal calls in the ocean... can travel up to 1600 kilometers and reach 189 decibels, as loud as the noises produced by large ships. ...Kuna says whale calls can’t completely substitute for air guns. But he believes the approach could be valuable in certain parts of the ocean—such as marine conservation areas—where air guns are outlawed because their loud noises disturb marine life....

By <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a>, Science Magazine. Excerpt: Shark populations in the high seas have fallen by 71% since 1970, researchers have found. The main cause is overfishing, which has put three-quarters of these species at risk of extinction. ...Humans have hunted sharks for centuries for their meat and fins. ...Studies have identified severe regional declines of specific species, such as the loss of scalloped hammerhead sharks in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, but no one had compiled trends in all oceans. In the new study, shark experts took a look at 31 species of oceanic sharks and rays—all of the species that live in the open ocean. ...the scientists calculated how populations have changed since 1970, a widely used benchmark. “Some of the declines are staggering,” says Nicholas Dulvy, a conservation biologist at Simon Fraser University and co-leader of the effort. Dusky sharks, for example, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03173-9">have dwindled by 72%</a>, the researchers report today in Nature. Only one-third of the 31 species were threatened in 1980, the researchers determined by looking at data from that time. Now, three-quarters are at risk of disappearing. ...The reason: too much fishing. Compared with 1970, boats today are bigger and do more fishing with gear that catches a lot of sharks, such as long lines of baited hooks. And many sharks have always been vulnerable to depletion because they take years to reach reproductive maturity. The good news is that fishing regulations can help species recover, such as bans on the landing of sharks. The white shark, for example, is bouncing back off the U.S. east and west coasts because of that kind of protection. For less endangered species, lessening the amount of catch can help significantly....

Excerpt: For decades, something in urban streams has been killing coho salmon in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Even after Seattle began to restore salmon habitat in the 1990s, up to 90% of the adults migrating up certain streams to spawn would suddenly die after rainstorms. Researchers suspected the killer was washing off nearby roads, but couldn’t identify it. “This was a serious mystery,” says Edward Kolodziej, an environmental engineer at the University of Washington’s (UW’s) Tacoma and Seattle campuses. Online today in Science, researchers led by Kolodziej <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/12/02/science.abd6951">report the primary culprit</a> comes from a chemical widely used to protect tires from ozone, a reactive atmospheric gas.

By Adrienne Sutton and Jan A. Newton, Eos/AGU. Excerpt: Media coverage concerning carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions into Earth’s atmosphere most often focuses on how these emissions affect climate and weather patterns. However, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is also the primary driver for ocean acidification, because the products of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> dissolving into seawater reduce seawater’s pH and its concentration of carbonate ions. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of the ocean has increased by over 30%. Some organisms in the ocean may struggle to adapt to increasingly acidified conditions, and even resilient life-forms may have a harder time finding food. Higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels in ocean water also make it difficult for shellfish to build their shells and corals to form their reefs, both of which are made of carbonate compounds. Ocean acidification, which affects the overall health of marine ecosystems as well as societal concerns about food security, has emerged as a major concern for decision-makers on local, regional, and global scales. Indeed, ocean acidification is now a headline <a href="https://climatedata-catalogue.wmo.int/climate_indicators">climate indicator</a> for the World Meteorological Organization. ...In February 2020, NOAA’s Ocean Acidification Program and the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (<a href="http://www.goa-on.org/">GOA-ON</a>) brought together a dozen scientists from the international community experienced in collecting data from time series stations scattered throughout the world’s oceans. With their expertise, and with input from scientists in other fields as well, the group began developing a set of best practices for uniformly analyzing long-term ocean acidification trends....

It might never recover</b>. By <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/darryl-fears/">Darryl Fears</a>, The Washington Post. Excerpt: Half of the coral populations on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef — from “big mamas” to the little baby coral they spawn — have been wiped out in the warming ocean, a new study says. Studying coral as if it were a residential demographic, and counting its abundance over 30 years starting in 1995, four Australian researchers determined that size didn’t matter when bleaching events, such as two that occurred in recent back-to-back years, strike the giant reef. “The decline occurred in both shallow and deeper water, and across virtually all species — but especially in branching and table-shaped corals,” Terry Hughes, a professor at the ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Queensland and a co-author of the research paper, said in a statement Tuesday. “These were the worst affected by record breaking temperatures that triggered mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017.” ...“We expect this decline to continue” because of warming caused by humans, Hughes said. “The only effective way to improve the outcome for coral reefs is global action on greenhouse gasses. If global temperatures rise to 3 or 4 [degrees Celsius], the reef will be unrecognizable, so there is no time to lose.”....

Now, researchers have tracked our plastic waste in another place—the deep sea.

They found an average of 41 pieces in each spoonful of sediment from continental shelves. ...when scientists sampled piles of sediment that build up in the deep ocean, adjacent to fast-flowing currents, they found 190 pieces of microplastics per spoonful of sediment, the highest concentration of microplastics from the sea floor to date, they report this month in Science [<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6495/1140" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6495/1140</a>]....

By Mara Johnson-Groh, Eos/AGU. Excerpt: ...“We have a very limited understanding of where all the plastic and stuff that’s being put into the ocean ends up,” said Matthias Egger, the lead scientist behind the new study and a researcher with The Ocean Cleanup. “We know roughly there’s tens of millions of tons of plastics going into the ocean. A large part of that should be afloat, but it’s not.” This mystery is known as the missing plastic problem. Plastic found adrift in the ocean makes up only 1% of what should be out there, though a large portion is thought to circulate in coastal environments. The largest known reservoirs of plastic at sea are giant, swirling “garbage patches” that can stretch over areas twice the size of Texas. Could some of the missing plastic have sunk beneath these massive gyres? ...The scientists estimated that between 5 and 2,000 meters below the surface, the total mass of plastic pieces smaller than 5 centimeters is 56%–80% of what is seen at the surface. In total, these plastics could compose 10% of the weight of plastics on the surface....

By Warren Cornwall, Science Magazine</b>. Excerpt: For the third time in 5 years, an underwater heat wave has turned vast stretches of coral on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef ghostly white, a desperate survival strategy that is often a prelude to coral death. Now, scientists there have taken a small step toward helping coral survive in a warmer world. For the first time, researchers have grown algae in a lab that can reduce coral bleaching, as it’s known. The results are a notable advance in the growing field of “assisted evolution,” in which scientists are working to alter coral genetics to help them endure hotter water.  ...Coral and their algae are deeply intertwined. The tiny, plantlike organisms live inside the cells of coral polyps, the small, anemonelike single animals that form colonies to create the fantastically shaped skeletons typically called coral. The algae, called zooxanthellae, use coral waste products to help photosynthesize food, while in turn nourishing the coral host. But that relationship sours during heat waves. Coral polyps eject the algae from their bodies, a phenomenon scientists suspect is a reaction to a flood of tissue-damaging molecules released by the overheated algae. Without their algae, the corals turn white, and, if the bleaching is severe enough, they can starve to death. Coral geneticist Madeleine van Oppen hoped the algae could be coaxed to evolve into strains that reduced the bleaching response....

But rising temperatures sent him back to the air in 2017, when the reef bleached again. Then he returned last month, leading to another devastating conclusion: The reef was being ravaged by bleaching yet again, this time across an even wider area. “It’s the first time we’ve seen severely bleached reefs along the whole length of the reef, in particular, the coastal reefs,” said Professor Hughes, the director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University. “Those are bleached everywhere.”...

Excerpt: ...Twenty-seven oil- and gas-drilling platforms dot the coastline of California, most of them in the Santa Barbara Channel. They were built from the 1960s through 1980s, and they’re showing their age—several are in the early stages of decommissioning. ...Researchers have now calculated the ecological impact of losing these human-made habitats. Over 95% of fish biomass around a platform would be lost if it were removed completely, the team found. Another option—severing platforms at a water depth of 26 meters and removing only the uppermost part of the structure—would deplete only about 10% of fish biomass, they concluded. ...The scientists calculated that removing the platforms in their entirety would result in 83%–99% losses in fish biomass. But cutting off just the top portion of the platforms—leaving structures below a water depth of 26 meters intact—would deplete, on average, just 10% of fish biomass. That significant difference makes sense, said Meyer-Gutbrod, because there’s “all of this added habitat” from a platform’s A-frame-shaped underwater structure. ...conversations will start about what to do with the infrastructure, whether to remove everything or leave some of it in place for an artificial reef....

And they are quietly disappearing. Following an exhaustive survey throughout the Yangtze River basin, researchers this month declared the Chinese paddlefish officially extinct [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719362382" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719362382</a>]. The paddlefish, last seen alive in 2003, could grow up to 23 feet long and once inhabited many of China’s rivers, but overfishing and dams decimated their populations. The paddlefish may be a harbinger for many other giant fish. According to research published in August in Global Change Biology, freshwater megafauna have declined by 88 percent worldwide in recent years.

Excerpt: Signifiers of the good life, local bivalves may be harbingers 
of another phenomenon: species extinction. ...roughly 7 million oysters 
... the five oyster farms on Tomales Bay sell each year to local 
restaurants and bars. ...Though Hog Island’s inventory had restabilized 
by 2013, ...We just couldn’t supply the product. It was painful—and 
still is because we’re not over it. The culprit? Ocean 
acidification—climate change’s caustic cousin—caused by rising carbon 
dioxide emissions. ...In 2005, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration began reporting that hatcheries throughout the West Coast
 were seeing steep declines in production, putting the $84 million 
industry in jeopardy. Hatchery staff and scientists scrambled to 
pinpoint the cause, .... It wasn’t until a year later that [Alan] Barton
 [or Whiskey Creek shellfish hatchery in Tillamook, Oregon] solved the 
mystery that had stumped scientists. On an ordinary summer day that was 
marred by a particularly bad die-off, he decided to test the pH levels 
in the tanks. ...Lo and behold, the pH level of the water was 
drastically lower (read: more corrosive) than usual. ...because the 
acidification is exacerbated by carbon dioxide emissions, every year it 
gets a little worse. ...These days, we release roughly 70 million tons 
per day—and the oceans soak up nearly a third of that. The result? On 
average, the sea is 30 percent more acidic than it was 200 years ago. 
And in the last decade, it began passing the point where young oysters 
can survive. It’s not necessarily the acidity that causes problems for 
the oysters, but rather the concomitant lack of carbonate ions in the 
water. Shellfish use these free-floating ions to build their shells. 
When seawater absorbs carbon dioxide, the number of carbonate ions 
available for the shellfish is reduced. “A baby oyster is trying to eat,
 grow, move around, and make a shell. So if it spends more energy trying
 to make a shell, then something else in that equation is going to 
suffer,” says Tessa Hill, a scientist with UC Davis who studies the 
impacts of rising carbon dioxide levels on native shellfish. “I say it’s
 like balancing your checkbook—you can’t spend a lot of energy on one 
thing without cutting back in some other category.” <a href="http://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/whats-killing-the-bay-areas-oysters" target="_blank">http://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/whats-killing-the-bay-areas-oysters</a>. By Jacoba Charles, San Francisco Magazine. <br />

Not all fish have the same carbon finprint, however, and a new study reveals which ones take the most fuel to catch. Robert Parker, a Ph.D. student at the University of Tasmania, Hobart, in Australia, and Peter Tyedmers, an ecological economist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, analyzed more than 1600 records of fuel use by fishing fleets worldwide. They ... reported online this month in Fish and Fisheries. 7. Sardines: 71 liters ...Icelandic herring and Peruvian anchovies are the least fuel-intensive industrial fisheries known, caught with just 8 liters of fuel per ton of fish. 6. Skipjack tuna: 434 liters ...5. Scallops: 525 liters ...4. North American salmon: 886 liters ...3. Pacific albacore: 1612 liters ...2. Sole: 2827 liters ...1. Shrimp and lobster: 2923 liters ...How does wild seafood compare with other kinds of animal protein? The median fuel use in the fisheries is 639 liters per ton. In terms of climate impact, that’s equivalent to a bit more than 2 kilograms of carbon dioxide emitted for each kilogram of seafood landed. Chicken and farmed salmon and trout are roughly the same, but beef is significantly higher at 10 kg of carbon dioxide per kg of live animal. “If you’re looking at having a green diet, you want to transition away from beef,” Parker says.... <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/07/what-seafood-guzzles-most-gas" target="_blank">http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/07/what-seafood-guzzles-most-gas</a>. by Erik Stokstad, Science.<br />

Excerpt: Sen. Malama Solomon says people should be prioritized over whales and green sea turtles. She wants NOAA to delist them as endangered. ...Hawaii’s whale population has increased 20-fold since the days of Gov. George Ariyoshi.... Last year, a group of Hawaii fishermen filed a petition with NOAA to have the whales removed from the endangered species list, noting their growing numbers. The humpback whales in the North Pacific have increased to more than 21,000 today, from about 1,400 in the mid-1960s, according to the Associated Press. The global whale population was decimated by the commercial whaling industry beginning in the early 20th century. In 1973, the federal government made it illegal to hunt or harm them. They are protected not only by the Endangered Species Act, but also by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, Hawaii wildlife laws and the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. In 1992, the U.S. Congress created the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary, jointly managed by NOAA and the state of Hawaii. ...The “waters around the main Hawaiian islands constitute one of the world’s most important North Pacific humpback whale habitats, and the only place in U.S. coastal waters where humpbacks reproduce,” according to NOAA’s web site.  ...The population of green sea turtles in Hawaii has also increased since they were placed on the endangered species list in 1978. ...increased six-fold since the 1970s, according to The Garden Island.

That’s the conclusion of an analysis of historical records of ship strikes on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the seas around the Hawaiian Islands between 1975 and 2011. In that 36-year period, 68 such strikes were reported, ...more than 63% of the collisions involved calves and subadults, ...younger animals are particularly susceptible to being struck, most likely because they spend more time at the surface to breathe than do adults. ...the number of strikes has steadily increased over the years, ...and not because there are more whales. Instead, the increase is apparently due to tourism. The majority of vessels that have collided with whales in Hawaii are small- to medium-sized boats, less than 21.2 meters in length, the scientists say, which happens to be the size of commercial whale-watching vessels. Federal regulations require these boats to remain at least 100 yards distance from the humpbacks. ...The majority of collisions occurred when the vessels were travelling at 10 to 19 knots, ...too fast to avoid colliding with the very animals the skippers and tourists have come out to watch. <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/plants-animals/2013/12/scienceshot-when-whale-watching-turns-deadly" target="_blank">http://news.sciencemag.org/plants-animals/2013/12/scienceshot-when-whale-watching-turns-deadly</a>.

It’s not bad enough that its population has been decimated by diners’ seemingly insatiable appetite for sushi. Or that the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred at the height of its spawning season, in its only known Western spawning grounds. No, bluefin also are plagued by another long-standing problem: They are inevitably caught by long-line fishermen trying to hook bigger, healthier schools of yellowfin tuna, swordfish and big-eye tuna. Under government regulations, the fishermen are allowed to bring a small number of the carefully regulated and valuable fish to shore for sale, but most of them die on hooks hanging from 20-mile fishing lines and are discarded at sea. ...By one estimate, 111 metric tons of bluefin were killed this way in one year. The “bycatch” problem is slowing efforts to rebuild the bluefin population in the western Atlantic, which is at 36 percent of the 1970 level, according to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. ...Now, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the U.S. government agency that regulates offshore fishing, ... is proposing ... sharply cut back the number of bluefin tuna that individual fishing vessels are allowed to capture accidentally, setting a quota for each boat and requiring fishermen to include the bluefin they discard at sea under that cap. The NMFS also would change the long-standing formula by which it calculates the number of pounds of bluefin tuna that a long-liner may legally bring to shore for sale. Any vessel that exceeds its cap for accidentally caught bluefin wouldn’t be able to leave the dock to fish for other species, according to the proposal.... <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-agency-proposes-rules-to-protect-bluefin-tuna/2013/11/03/e3b653d8-4339-11e3-a624-41d661b0bb78_story.html" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-agency-proposes-rules-to-protect-bluefin-tuna/2013/11/03/e3b653d8-4339-11e3-a624-41d661b0bb78_story.html</a>.

Trawl nets, drift nets, longlines, GPS, sonar... As a result, fishing operations have expanded to virtually all corners of the ocean over the past century. ...That, in turn, has put a strain on fish populations. The world's marine fisheries peaked in the 1990s, when the global catch was higher than it is today. And the populations of key commercial species like bluefin tuna and cod have dwindled, in some cases falling more than 90 percent. So just how badly are we overfishing the oceans? Are fish populations going to keep shrinking each year — or could they recover? ...The pessimistic view, famously expressed by fisheries expert Daniel Pauly, is that we may be facing "The End of Fish." One especially dire 2006 study in Science warned that many commercial ocean fish stocks were on pace to “collapse” by mid-century — at which point they would produce less than 10 percent of their peak catch.  ...Other experts have countered that this view is far too alarmist. A number of countries have worked hard to improve their fisheries management over the years, including Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.

By Emma Bryce, The NY Times. Excerpt: A study released today by the Australian Institute of Marine Science shows that the Great Barrier Reef — a Heritage Site frequently held up as one of the world’s most striking coral conservation successes — has experienced considerable decline since 1985, and without intervention, live coral cover is projected to decrease another 5 to 10 percent over the next 10 years. Over the last 27 years, the study found, coral cover across the 133,000-square mile stretch of the Great Barrier Reef has fallen to 13.8 percent over all, from 28 percent. The study broke down the causes of the decline, attributing 48 percent of coral loss to cyclones, 10 percent to coral bleaching and the remainder — 42 percent — to excessive spawning of destructive crown of thorns starfish. The starfish, believed by researchers to prosper when artificial nutrients increase in oceans, consume and destroy more than their fair share of live coral cover.....<br />

  By Sean B. Carroll, New York Times.  Excerpt: GUBBIO, Italy — 
…Limestone is composed largely of crystallized calcium carbonate. Some 
of it comes from the skeletal remains of well-known creatures like 
corals, but much of the rest comes from less appreciated but truly 
remarkable organisms called foraminifera, or forams for short. Forams 
have been called “nature’s masons,” … these single-celled protists 
construct surprisingly complex, ornate and beautiful shells to protect 
their bodies. After forams die, their shells settle in ocean sediments….
 While tiny relative to ourselves …, forams are extremely large for 
single-celled organisms, … largest forams can reach a few centimeters. 
...Forams are a vital part of a “biological pump” that removes carbon 
dioxide from the atmosphere. When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, 
one reaction product is carbonate. In making their calcium carbonate 
shells, the large mass of so-called planktonic forams floating in the 
upper levels of the oceans sequester about one quarter of all carbonate 
produced in the oceans each year.<br />
The increasing levels of carbon dioxide in our planet’s atmosphere, now 
at a greater level than at any time in the past 400,000 years, threaten 
to overwhelm this biological pump by inhibiting the formation of calcium
 carbonate shells. As more carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean, the 
waters acidify, decreasing the concentration of carbonate and making it 
more difficult for these organisms to form calcium carbonate shells….

Excerpt: GLOUCESTER, Mass. — Standing on the deck of his rusted steel trawler, Naz Sanfilippo fumed about the latest bad news for New England fishermen: a decision by Whole Foods to stop selling any seafood it does not consider sustainable. …Starting Sunday, gray sole and skate, common catches in the region, will no longer appear in the grocery chain’s artfully arranged fish cases. Atlantic cod, a New England staple, will be sold only if it is not caught by trawlers, which drag nets across the ocean floor, a much-used method here. “It’s totally maddening,” Mr. Sanfilippo said. “They’re just doing it to make all the green people happy.” Whole Foods says that, in fact, it is doing its part to address the very real problem of overfishing and help badly depleted fish stocks recover. It is using ratings set by the Blue Ocean Institute, a conservation group, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. They are based on factors including how abundant a species is, how quickly it reproduces and whether the catch method damages its habitat. …Some question the need for grocery stores to reject certain American-caught fish when the government has already imposed its own conservation measures.

But this rural coastal spot and the shellfish it has nurtured for centuries are a bellwether of one of the most palpable changes being caused by global carbon dioxide emissions — ocean acidification….<br />
…Ocean acidification — which makes it difficult for shellfish, corals, sea urchins, and other creatures to form the shells or calcium-based structures they need to live — was supposed to be a problem of the future. But because of patterns of ocean circulation, Pacific Northwest shellfish are already on the front lines of these potentially devastating changes in ocean chemistry….<br />
...Because of the way seawater circulates around the world, the deep water now washing ashore in Oregon and Washington is actually 30 to 50 years old and absorbed its CO2 long before the fall of the Berlin Wall. This time lag is important because oceans absorb about 50 percent of the CO2 released by burning fossil fuels, emissions that have been rising dramatically in recent decades. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ocean acidity has increased approximately 30 percent since the Industrial Revolution, and if we continue our current rate of carbon emissions, global oceans could be 150 percent more acidic by the end of the century than they have been for 20 million years…..<br />

It lasted three days but wiped out an estimated nine-tenths of the catch, compared with two years earlier. Scientists blamed global warming, citing increased temperatures in the lower waters where lobsters live. Another culprit was pesticides like those deployed against the West Nile virus. The die-off began around the same time that the remnants of Hurricane Floyd swept over Long Island and, lobstermen believe, flushed pesticides into the Sound. The past 12 years have not been kind.

Excerpt: The iconic California mussel could be among the first casualties of oceans made more acidic by global warming, a new study of the coastal shellfish shows. Scientists who grew mussel larvae in a bath of acidified water thought to match expected changes in ocean chemistry report thinner, weaker shells and smaller bodies in a newly published study. <br />
"Indications from records are that acidity increased by about 30 percent in the last 250 years," Gaylord said. <br />
…With little sign of a slackening of carbon dioxide, or CO2, emissions, changes in ocean chemistry seem almost inevitable, he said.<br />
"These changes are going to proceed even if we stop emitting anymore CO2," Gaylord said. "Humans have made the commitment to an altered environment."<br />

By Elisabeth Rosenthal, The NY Times.  Excerpt: …An invasive species, the lionfish is devastating reef fish populations along the Florida coast and into the Caribbean. Now, an increasing number of environmentalists, consumer groups and scientists are seriously testing a novel solution to control it and other aquatic invasive species — one that would also takes pressure off depleted ocean fish stocks: they want Americans to step up to their plates and start eating invasive critters in large numbers.<br />
 “Humans are the most ubiquitous predators on earth,” said Philip Kramer, director of the Caribbean program for the Nature Conservancy. “Instead of eating something like shark fin soup, why not eat a species that is causing harm, and with your meal make a positive contribution?”….<br />
 …Scientists emphasize that human consumption is only part of what is needed to control invasive species and restore native fish populations, and that a comprehensive plan must include restoring fish predators to depleted habitats and erecting physical barriers to prevent further dissemination of the invaders….<br />

Excerpt: [Narrative of an ichthyologist working in Madagascar]…The native Paretroplus are striking fish, deep bodied forms that bear a close resemblance to their closest relatives on the Indian subcontinent, the genus Etroplus, despite being isolated since the Late Cretaceous period. There are less than 15 species of Paretroplus, and all but two are restricted to northwestern Madagascar. It is no exaggeration to state that a majority of these 15 species have some of the most restricted ranges of any vertebrates, frequently comprising only a short stretch of river or single small lake. Only Paretroplus polyactis has a widespread distribution along the eastern coast. Regrettably, most species of damba are on the verge of extinction, perhaps as a result of this strict endemism….<br />

Excerpt: ...Researchers at a European Union-financed program, Selfdott, said they had succeeded in spawning the Atlantic bluefin in captivity without hormonal intervention.<br />
 If they can solve the problem of raising the offspring to adulthood — a challenging prospect — the bluefin may soon join Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, branzino, yellowtail, turbot, shrimp, catfish and tilapia as an industrially farmed staple of the modern fish market. Which brings up an interesting question: Can a farmed version of bluefin tuna be better for the earth — and the species?<br />
 ...Seafood today is roughly where landfood was 10,000 odd years ago. Just as Neolithic humans launched a domestication project after the last Ice Age and eventually replaced many wild mammal populations with tame ones, so, too, are modern humans parsing and domesticating the ocean, fish by fish.<br />
 Cultivating Atlantic bluefin tuna, environmentalists argue, could be even more harmful to the ocean than salmon farming. Atlantic bluefin are already ranched in great numbers — taken from the wild and fattened in net pens with wild forage fish like herring and sardines. ...The effect on forage fish, the foundation of the oceanic food chain, could be devastating. A worldwide overharvest of forage fish could damage not just bluefin tuna populations but other important commercial species that also rely on these fish for sustenance.<br />
 ...If Atlantic bluefin is not farmed, it will most likely become an even more scarce luxury item. Global fishing moratoriums on the species have been proposed (and then rejected by the many nations that catch bluefin). <br />

Excerpt: …“We flipped on the lights, and there was one of the largest coral reefs in the Gulf of Mexico sitting right in front of us,” said Erik Cordes, a marine biologist at Temple University and chief scientist on the vessel, the Ronald H. Brown. <br />
 ...Nine months later, the warm thrill of discovery has cooled into dread. The reef lies just 20 miles northeast of BP’s blown-out well, making it one of at least three extensive deepwater reefs lying directly beneath the oil slick in the gulf. <br />
 ...Studies on the effects of oil and chemicals on coral are limited to the shallow-water variety, however. Essentially no research has been conducted on their slow-growing deepwater cousins. So BP’s spill has prompted scientists to embark on a sudden crash course on the interaction of deep-sea biology with these toxins. <br />

Excerpt: …Now Thelma and others of her species are being monitored closely by worried scientists as another major oil disaster threatens their habitat. Federal officials said Tuesday that since April 30, 10 days after the accident on the Deepwater Horizon, they have recorded 156 sea turtle deaths; most of the turtles were Kemp’s ridleys. And though they cannot say for sure that the oil was responsible, the number is far higher than usual for this time of year, the officials said. <br />
<br />
…The turtles may be more vulnerable than any other large marine animals to the oil spreading through the gulf. An ancient creature driven by instinct, it forages for food along the coast from Louisiana to Florida, in the path of the slick. <br />
<br />
…Then came the blowout on the Ixtoc 1. The deepwater well dumped three million barrels of crude into the gulf, covering the beach at Rancho Nuevo. Nine thousand hatchlings had to be airlifted to nearby beaches. Although the role of the oil in killing the turtles was never confirmed, by 1985, there were fewer than 1,000 Kemp’s ridleys left. <br />

Of course, conventional plastic doesn’t readily biodegrade; so where is it now? If you live in North America or Asia, there’s a chance that cup is trapped in a broad ocean current, known as a gyre, in the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean along with an untold number of other pieces of litter in what has been named the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.<br />

Excerpt: ...Light bulbs, bottle caps, toothbrushes, Popsicle sticks and tiny pieces of plastic, each the size of a grain of rice, inhabit the Pacific garbage patch, an area of widely dispersed trash that doubles in size every decade and is now believed to be roughly twice the size of Texas. But one research organization estimates that the garbage now actually pervades the Pacific, though most of it is caught in what oceanographers call a gyre like this one — an area of heavy currents and slack winds that keep the trash swirling in a giant whirlpool.<br />
 Scientists say the garbage patch is just one of five that may be caught in giant gyres scattered around the world’s oceans. Abandoned fishing gear like buoys, fishing line and nets account for some of the waste, but other items come from land after washing into storm drains and out to sea.<br />
 Plastic is the most common refuse in the patch because it is lightweight, durable and an omnipresent, disposable product in both advanced and developing societies. It can float along for hundreds of miles before being caught in a gyre and then, over time, breaking down.<br />
 But once it does split into pieces, the fragments look like confetti in the water. Millions, billions, trillions and more of these particles are floating in the world's trash-filled gyres.... <br />

Excerpt: The North Pacific Ocean is now commonly referred to as the world's largest garbage dump with an area the size of the continental United States covered in plastic debris. The highly mobile Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis), which forages throughout the North Pacific, is quickly becoming the poster child for the effects of plastic ingestion on marine animals due to their tendency to ingest large amounts of plastic.<br />
 ...Dr. Lindsay Young of the University of Hawaii and her colleagues examined whether Laysan albatrosses nesting on Kure Atoll and Oahu, Hawaii, 2,150 km away, ingested different amounts of plastic by putting miniaturized tracking devices on birds to follow them at sea and examining their regurgitated stomach contents. Surprisingly, birds from Kure Atoll ingested almost ten times the amount of plastic compared to birds from Oahu.<br />
 ...The most common identifiable items they found were paraphernalia from the fishing industry such as line, light sticks, oyster spacers, and lighters....Unfortunately, while the albatross examined in this study were able to purge themselves of the plastic by regurgitating it, thousands of albatross die each year as a result of ingesting plastic debris. Plastic ingestion leads to blockage of the digestive tract, reduced food consumption, satiation of hunger, and potential exposure to toxic compounds to name but a few of its detrimental effects.... <br />

But every summer since 2002, the Pacific Northwest's coastal waters--one of the--one of the U.S.'s most important fisheries--has been invaded by massive dead zones that are believed to be caused by an entirely different and surprising phenomena: changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation that may, in turn, be caused by climate change.... <br />

Only 64 to 76 Irrawaddy dolphins remain in the Mekong, it says, and calls for a cross-border plan to help the dolphins.<br />
 Toxic levels of pesticides, mercury and other pollutants have been found in more than 50 calves that have died since 2003.<br />
 ..."These pollutants are widely distributed in the environment and so the source of this pollution may involve several countries through which the Mekong river flows," said WWF veterinary surgeon Verne Dove in a press statement.<br />
 ..."Necropsy analysis identified a bacterial disease as the cause of the calf deaths," Dr Dove said in the WWF report. "This disease would not be fatal unless the dolphin's immune systems were suppressed, as they were in these cases, by environmental contaminants," he said.<br />
 Researchers found toxic levels of pesticides such as DDT and environmental contaminants such as PCBs during analysis of the dead dolphin calves. These pollutants may also pose a health risk to human populations living along the Mekong - who consume the same fish and water as the dolphins - the group suggested.<br />
 High levels of mercury were also found in some of the dead dolphins, which directly affects the immune system making the animals more susceptible to infectious disease.... <br />

Excerpt: SEKISEI LAGOON, Japan — Beneath the waves of this sapphire-blue corner of the East China Sea, a team of divers was busily at work.<br />
 Hovering along the steep, bony face of a dying coral reef, some divers bored holes into the hard surface with compressed-air drills that released plumes of glittering bubbles. Others followed, gently inserting small ceramic discs into the fresh openings.<br />
 Each disc carried a tiny sliver of hope for the reef, in the shape of fingertip-size sprigs of brightly colored, fledgling coral.<br />
 This undersea work site...is part of a government-led effort to save Japan’s largest coral reef, near the southern end of the Okinawa chain of islands. True to form in Japan, the project involves new technology, painstaking attention to detail and a generous dose of taxpayer money.<br />
 The project has drawn national attention, coming after alarming reports in the last decade that up to 90 percent of the coral that surrounds many of Okinawa’s islands has died off....<br />

 Critics, however, say the project might be wasted effort. They say transplanting is futile without addressing the problems that caused the reefs to deteriorate in the first place, like coastal redevelopment and chemical runoff from terrestrial agriculture. There is also the bigger problem of rising ocean water temperatures, for which there may be no easy fix.... <br />

Excerpt: ...They're descendants of one of the oldest family trees in history, spanning 100 million years. But today leatherback turtles, the most widely distributed reptiles on Earth, are threatened with extinction themselves...<br />
 We've seen reference to the dangers plastic poses to marine life..., but how clearly have we received the message? Not well enough according to a recent article in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin co-authored by Dalhousie University's Mike James.<br />
 “We wanted to see if plastics ingestion in leatherbacks was hype or reality,” says Dr. James, senior species at risk biologist for Fisheries and Oceans Canada and adjunct professor with Dalhousie’s Department of Biology.<br />
 “It was a monumental effort that looked back at necropsies over the last century from all over the world,” he explains. (Necropsies are post-mortem examinations performed on animals.) “After reviewing the results of 371 necropsies since 1968, we discovered over one third of the turtles had ingested plastic.”<br />
 ...Once leatherbacks ingest plastic, thousands of spines lining the throat and esophagus make it nearly impossible to regurgitate. The plastic can lead to partial or even complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in decreased digestive efficiency, energetic and reproductive costs and, for some, starvation.<br />
 ...“The frustrating, yet hopeful aspect is that humans can easily begin addressing the solution, without major lifestyle changes,” says Dr. James. “It's as simple as reducing packaging and moving towards alternative, biodegradable materials and recycling.”... <br />

By David Biello, Scientific American.Excerpt: The shells of tiny ocean animals known as foraminifera—specifically Globigerina bulloides—are shrinking as a result of the slowly acidifying waters of the Southern Ocean near Antarctica. The reason behind the rising acidity: Higher carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere, making these shells more proof that climate change is making life tougher for the seas' shell-builders. <br />
 ...The researchers found that modern G. bulloides could not build shells as large as the ones their ancestors formed as recently as century ago. In fact, modern shells were 35 percent smaller than in the relatively recent past—an average of 17.4 micrograms compared with 26.8 micrograms before industrialization. (One microgram is one millionth of a gram; there are 28.3 grams in an ounce.) <br />
 "We don't yet know what impact this will have on the organisms' health or survival," [says study co-author William Howard, a marine geologist at ACE], but one thing seems clear: the tiny animals won't be storing as much CO2 in their shells in the form of carbonate. "If the shell-making is reduced, the storage of carbon in the ocean might be, as well."<br />
 That's bad news for the climate, because the ocean is responsible for absorbing at least one quarter of the CO2 that humans load into the air through fossil fuel burning and other activities—and it is the action of foraminifera and other tiny shell-building animals, along with plants like algae that lock it away safely for millennia.... <br />

Excerpt: ...The fierce appetite for live reef fish across Southeast Asia — and increasingly in mainland China — is devastating populations in the Coral Triangle, a protected marine region home to the world’s richest ocean diversity, according to a recent report in the scientific journal Conservation Biology. Spawning of reef fish in this area, which supports 75 percent of all known coral species in the world, has declined 79 percent over the past 5 to 20 years, depending on location, according to the report.<br />
 Overfishing in general, and particularly of spawning aggregations that occur when certain species of reef fish gather in one place in great numbers to reproduce, may be the culprit, says Yvonne Sadovy, a biologist at the University of Hong Kong who wrote the report along with scientists from Australia, Hong Kong, Palau and the United States.<br />
 ...Since the 1980s, Hong Kong has been the epicenter of the live fish trade. That trade has greatly expanded in the last decade to an $810 million business, according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature, which monitors the market. Rising wealth in mainland China may be a contributing factor to the increase in the trade with the demand for exotic fish especially high in Shanghai and Beijing. Destinations popular with Chinese tourists are seeing an increase, too....<br />
 ...Even locals unaffiliated with the tourist trade are aware of the surge. Across the street from the Port View, Malays at the famous Night Market speak with awe about the Chinese tourists who spend “a thousand ringgits a week just eating fish.”That’s about $280.... <br />

                   The world has lost nearly one-fifth of its
                   coral reefs and much of the rest could be
                   destroyed by increasingly acidic seas if climate
                   change continues unchecked, an environmental
                   group warned Wednesday.<br />
                   Global warming and the rising temperature
                   of the oceans are the latest and most serious
                   threats to coral, already damaged by destructive
                   fishing methods and pollution, the International
                   Union for Conservation of Nature said.<br />
                   ''The world has lost about 19 percent of its
                   coral reefs during the last 20 years,'' said
                   IUCN's director general, Julia Marton-Lefevre...<br />
                   ''If current trends in carbon dioxide emission
                   continue, many of the remaining reefs will
                   be lost in the next 20 to 40 years,'' she
                   told reporters....<br />
                   Increasing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere,
                   which fuels global warming, is raising the
                   level as well as the temperature of the oceans,
                   said Olof Linden of the World Maritime University
                   in Malmo, Sweden. That makes the water more
                   acidic, adversely affecting reef-building

                   Tentacles Offer Hint of Oceans’ Decline.</a> By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,
                   The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     BARCELONA, Spain — Blue
                     patrol boats crisscross the swimming areas
                     of beaches here with their huge nets skimming
                     the water’s surface. The yellow flags
                     that urge caution and the red flags that prohibit
                     swimming because of risky currents are sometimes
                     topped now with blue ones warning of a new
                     danger: swarms of jellyfish.<br />
                     In a period of hours during a day a couple
                     of weeks ago, 300 people on Barcelona’s
                     bustling beaches were treated for stings,
                     and 11 were taken to hospitals.<br />
                     From Spain to New York, to Australia, Japan
                     and Hawaii, jellyfish are becoming more numerous
                     and more widespread, and they are showing
                     up in places where they have rarely been seen
                     before, scientists say....<br />
                     But while jellyfish invasions are a nuisance
                     to tourists and a hardship to fishermen, for
                     scientists they are a source of more profound
                     alarm, a signal of the declining health of
                     the world’s oceans.<br />
                     ...The explosion of jellyfish populations,
                     scientists say, reflects a combination of
                     severe overfishing of natural predators, like
                     tuna, sharks and swordfish; rising sea temperatures
                     caused in part by global warming; and pollution
                     that has depleted oxygen levels in coastal
                     shallows....</span>

                     Already in Danger, Are Facing New Threat
                     From Farmed Algae.</a> By CHRISTOPHER
                     PALA, The New York Times. <span>Excerpt:
                       BUTARITARI, Kiribati — Off the palm-fringed
                       white beach of this remote Pacific atoll,
                       the view underwater is downright scary.<br />
                       Corals are being covered and smothered to
                       death by a bushy seaweed that is so tough
                       even algae-grazing fish avoid it. It settles
                       in the reef’s crevices that fish once
                       called home, driving them away.<br />
                       Dead coral stops supporting the ecosystem
                       and, within a couple of decades, it will crumble
                       into rubble, allowing big ocean waves to reach
                       the beach during storms and destroy the flimsy
                       thatched huts of the Micronesians.<br />
                       “We are catching less and less fish,
                       and the seaweeds are fouling our nets,” says
                       Henry Totie, a fisherman and Butaritari’s
                       traditional chief, in an interview in his
                       traditionally built house in the village near
                       the blue-green lagoon.<br />
                       “This is one of the most damaging seaweeds
                       I have ever seen,” says Jennifer E.
                       Smith of the National Center for Ecological
                       Analysis and Synthesis at the University of
                       California, Santa Barbara, who has studied
                       the Hawaiian invasion for eight years...<br />
                       Moiwa Erutarem, the Butaritari representative
                       of the fisheries ministry, said the biggest
                       losses were being felt by the most vulnerable:
                       those who use nets in the shallow coral table
                       and do not have the boats required to fish
                       farther away. Seafood is virtually the only
                       source of protein in Butaritari, complemented
                       by breadfruit and coconut.<br />
                       This equatorial island of 4,000 people is
                       the latest victim of a 30-year global effort
                       to encourage poor people in the coastal areas
                       of the tropics to grow seaweed that, while
                       not edible, produces carrageenan, an increasingly
                       sought-after binder and fat substitute used
                       in the food industry, notably in ice cream.</span>..

                       the Toll on an Elder of the Sea.</a> By NATALIE ANGIER, The New York
                       Times. <span>Excerpt: MILFORD, Conn. - Horseshoe
                         crabs may look ancient and alien and battery-operated,
                         they may look like Wilma Flintstone's idea
                         of a Roomba vacuum cleaner, yet to the sixth-grade
                         students from Columbus School in nearby Bridgeport,
                         the most outrageous thing about the bronze-helmeted
                         creatures crawling clumsily along the beach
                         was not their appearance but their size -
                         or rather sizes.<br />
                         One boy pointed to a linked pair of horseshoe
                         crabs, a relatively compact specimen maybe
                         seven inches across clinging to the tail end
                         of a much larger companion. A kid crab hitching
                         a ride on its mother? No, explained Jennifer
                         H. Mattei, head of the biology department
                         at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, who
                         led the expedition. They were both full-grown,
                         a male and a female, and the female was the
                         bruiser out front.<br />
                         Among horseshoe crabs, Dr. Mattei explained,
                         adult females are a good 25 to 30 percent
                         bigger than their mates, a fact that the girls
                         greeted with hoots of triumph, boys of indignation.
                         Why are the females bigger? a boy demanded.
                         It's supposed to be the other way around!<br />
                         As it turned out, the answer to that question
                         was closely tied to the reason the students
                         from Cheryl Crevier's class had ventured out
                         on a flawless June morning to the shores of
                         Long Island Sound. With clipboards purposefully
                         in hand and tape measures jauntily around
                         neck, the 22 children were there to help catch,
                         measure and tag as many specimens as they
                         could find of the American horseshoe crab,
                         or Limulus polyphemus, one of the oldest and
                         most tenacious species on Earth. Fossils found
                         this year in Manitoba reveal that the animal's
                         architecture has hardly changed in 445 million
                         years.<br />
                         The student project is part of a major effort
                         now under way from Maine to Florida...(<a href="www.projectlimulus.html" target="_blank">www.projectlimulus.org</a>).
                         Experts are desperate to know whether their
                         suspicions are correct - that as a result
                         of being harvested en masse for use as fishing
                         bait, horseshoe crab populations are beginning
                         to crash.<br />
                         The loss of the horseshoe crab would be tragic,
                         researchers said, not only because the creatures
                         are fascinating and cute and predate the dinosaurs
                         by 200 million years, but also because so
                         many contemporary life forms depend on them.
                         Their annual spawns draw hundreds of species
                         of migratory birds, predatory fish, reptiles,
                         amphibians and various other alimentary canals
                         eager to brunch on the freshly deposited Limulus
                         eggs.<br />
                         ..."A single female horseshoe crab can put
                         down 80,000 eggs a year, four million in her
                         lifetime," said John T. Tanacredi, a
                         professor of earth and marine sciences at
                         Dowling College in Oakdale, N.Y....<br />
                         In the last few years, the Asian market for
                         North American eel and conch meat has soared,
                         and it seems that gravid female horseshoe
                         crabs make the best bait. Even the stalwart
                         Limulus can't last if all its eggs end up
                         in one basket - shaped like a fisherman's
                         boat. </span>

                             remarkable pace from the rapidly flicking
                             crochet hooks wielded by members of the audience.<br />

                            said Margaret Wertheim, an organizer of the

                            As she explained to the 40 people, nearly
                            all women, who had gathered at New York University
                            on Saturday, "This has grown from something
                             that was a little object on our coffee table" to
                             an exhibition that, so far, spreads over 3,000
                             square feet. And that was before the addition
                             of that day's catch.<br />
                            ...the Wertheims got the idea for the Hyperbolic

                            In the university's auditorium Ms. Wertheim
                            opened a large bag and began throwing out
                            long snaking tubes, tightly scrunched blooms,
                            fat textured spirals, and hairy coiled cactuses
                            created out of yarn, thread, plastic bags,
                            ties, can flip tops, videotape, ribbon, tinsel
                            and more in a riotous splash of reds, blues,

                            Later the group members traipsed upstairs

                            at one of six thick wooden worktables and
                            began crocheting. The woven organisms developed

                               according to the first detailed global map
                               of human impacts on the seas. A study in Science
                               journal says climate change, fishing, pollution
                               and other human factors have exacted a heavy
                               toll on almost half of the marine waters.
                               Only remote icy areas near the poles are relatively
                               pristine, but they face threats as ice sheets
                               melt, it warns.<br />

                               have shown the impact of individual activities," he
                               said. "But here for the first time we
                               have produced a global map of all of these
                               different activities layered on top of each
                               other so that we can get this big picture
                               of the overall impact that humans are having
                               rather than just single impacts."<br />
                             ...The researchers divided the world's oceans
                             into 1km-square sections and examined all
                             real data available on how humankind is influencing
                             the marine environment. They then calculated "human
                               impact scores" for each location, presenting
                               this as a global map of the toll people have
                               exacted on the seas. The scientists say they
                               were shocked by the findings. "I think
                               the big surprise from all of this was seeing
                               what the complete coverage of human impacts
                               was," said Dr Spalding, senior marine
                               scientist for international conservation group
                               The Nature Conservancy. "There's nowhere
                               really that escaped. It's quite a shocking
                               map to see." He said the two biggest
                               drivers in destroying marine habitats were
                               climate change and over-fishing.... </span>

                                   for life: the food you eat is only as safe
                                   as the 
                                   environment it comes from. This is narrowly

                                     2100, warmer oceans with more carbon dioxide
                                     may no longer sustain 1 of the world's most
                                     productive fisheries, says USC marine ecologist.
                                     The last fish you ate probably came from
                                     the Bering Sea. But during this century,
                                     the sea's rich food web stretching from
                                     Alaska to Russia-could fray as algae adapt
                                     to greenhouse conditions. "All the
                                     fish that ends up in McDonald's, fish sandwiches-that's
                                     all Bering Sea fish," said
                                     USC marine ecologist Dave Hutchins, whose
                                     former student at the University of Delaware,

                                     the Bering Sea provides roughly half the
                                     fish caught in U.S. waters each year and
                                     nearly a third caught worldwide. "The
                                     experiments we did up there definitely suggest
                                     that the changing ecosystem may support
                                     less of what we're harvesting things like
                                     pollock and hake," Hutchins said. </span>

                                         In its order, the Court considered both the

                   lie dozens of enormous ponds filled with murky
                   brown water and teeming with eels, shrimp
                   and tilapia, much of it destined for markets
                   in Japan and the West....Fuqing is No. 1 on
                   a list for refused seafood shipments from
                   China....the two most glaring environmental
                   weaknesses in China: acute water shortages
                   and water supplies contaminated by sewage,
                   industrial waste and agricultural runoff that
                   includes pesticides. The fish farms, in turn,
                   are discharging wastewater that further pollutes
                   the water supply.<br />
                   "Our waters here are filthy," said
                   Ye Chao, an eel and shrimp farmer who has
                   20 giant ponds in western Fuqing. "There
                   are simply too many aquaculture farms in this
                   area. They're all discharging water here,
                   fouling up other farms." Farmers have
                   coped with the toxic waters by mixing illegal
                   veterinary drugs and pesticides into fish
                   feed, which helps keep their stocks alive
                   yet leaves poisonous and carcinogenic residues
                   in seafood, posing health threats to consumers.<br />
                   ...No one is more vulnerable to these health
                   risks than the Chinese, because most of the
                   seafood in China stays at home. But foreign
                   importers are also worried.<br />
                   ...China produces about 70 percent of the
                   farmed fish in the world, harvested at thousands
                   of giant factory-style farms that extend along

                   Study Lake Champlain Eel Decline</a>. (AP) <span>Excerpt: Scientists
                     are trying to determine what caused Lake
                     Champlain's populations of American eels
                     to decline to almost nothing 
                     over the last two decades. ..Until the early
                     1980s ...commercial 
                     anglers would harvest tons of them every year. "We
                     have a fairly large vertebrate that has gone
                     from abundant to 
                     virtually absent in 20 years," said Tom
                     Berry, Lake Champlain program 
                     director for the Nature Conservancy. ...By
                     the early 1990s Quebec 
                     banned the commercial fishing of eels.
                     American eels start life in the Sargasso Sea,
                     an area in the Atlantic 
                     Ocean between the West Indies and the Azores.
                     After hatching, eel 
                     larvae float on ocean currents to East Coast
                     rivers, including the 
                     St. Lawrence. Historically, immature female
                     eels swam up the St. 
                     Lawrence and Richelieu rivers and lived 10
                     to 20 years in Lake 
                     Champlain before returning to the Sargasso
                     Sea. "It is just remarkable they travel
                     3,000 miles when they are only an 
                     inch long. It boggles the mind," said
                     UVM fisheries biologist Ellen 
                     Marsden.<br />
                     Biologists do not fully understand the reason
                     for the decline. <br />
                     Theories include climate change, pollution,
                     and overfishing of young 
                     eels.
                     But the decline could also be due to the reconstruction
                     in the 1960s 
                     of two hydroelectric dams on the Richelieu
                     River in Quebec. The dams 
                     could have prevented the eels from reaching
                     Lake Champlain.
                     A decade ago, Hydro-Quebec installed an eel
                     ladder at one of the 
                     dams. "Within 10 days we measured eels
                     going up the ladder," said <br />

                       see... an array of concrete disks set in the
                       sand. Each one held a tiny piece of coral.
                       Mr. Nedimyer had led them to a nursery, one
                       of a number he has established since 2000,
                       .... He is working with assistance from the
                       conservancy, which in turn cooperates with
                       the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary
                       and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
                       which has its own coral efforts in places
                       like Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the Environmental
                       Protection Agency is looking at water quality
                       standards for corals in Florida, Hawaii, the

                       globally are already so damaged, and so threatened
                       by further environmental degradation, that

                       were once abundant in South Florida, the

                       since the 1990s they have significantly declined,
                       to the point that last year they were placed
                       on the threatened list, under the Endangered
                       Species Act...."We
                       have lost 25 percent of the world's corals
                       in the last 25 years," David E.
                       Vaughan, director of the Center for Coral
                       Reef Research at Mote, said in an interview,
                       adding that 25 percent more are expected to
                       die in the next decade or two. "Sometimes
                       we sound like doomsday sayers," Dr. Vaughan
                       said, "but those are the facts." ...Corals
                       in South Florida have another big problem,
                       a die-off of sea urchins, which began succumbing
                       wholesale to a mysterious ailment about
                       20 years ago. Urchins graze on unwanted
                       algae, and without them, corals in many
                       areas have been smothered in overgrowth,

                 Reefs</a>. By CHRISTOPHER
                 PALA. NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   NGIWAL, Palau - ...on Palau's main island
                   of Babeldaob, Islias Yano, 57, ..."We
                   fished certain fish in certain seasons," he
                   recalled. "Each reef
                   could only be fished by people from a certain
                   village." Village elders would rotate
                   fishing on reefs, he recounted, to husband
                   their slow-growing main source of food. Starting
                   in the 1980s, population growth, new seafood
                   markets in Asia and modern ways of thinking
                   washed away the elders' authority and rules. "Outsiders
                   started coming into our reefs, they used scuba
                   gear and dynamite, and the fish got smaller
                   and fewer," Mr. Yano said, shaking his
                   head. ... In Ngiwal, the reaction was not
                   long in coming. Once again, the elders ruled.
                   In 1994, they banned fishing in a small area
                   of reef that was partly accessible on foot.
                   The village women, who traditionally gather
                   shellfish at low tide, noticed how the fish
                   became more plentiful there in a few years.
                   The reef became locally famous, and other
                   villages started to do the same. Today, Palau,
                   a tiny island state 600 miles east of the
                   Philippines that is internationally known
                   as a site for recreational diving, is at the
                   forefront of a worldwide movement to ban fishing
                   in key reefs to allow the return of prized
                   species. It now protects a patchwork of reefs
                   and lagoon waters amounting to 460 square
                   miles. ...That Palau has taken the lead in
                   ocean conservation is no accident. Even among
                   Pacific peoples, Palauans have been known
                   for prizing fish and seafood over meat and
                   farmed vegetables, and its fishermen have
                   stood out for their keen understanding of
                   the reefs. ...</span>

                     is dry and crunches underfoot. Dazed villagers
                     stand on the shoreline, still coming to terms
                     with the cataclysmic shift that changed the
                     geography of their island forever, pushing
                     the shoreline out to sea by up to 70 metres.

                     exploring the new underwater landscape of
                     the island with a snorkel when contacted by
                     the AFP team. He said a huge submerged chasm
                     had opened up, running at least 500 metres
                     (550 yards) parallel to the coast. On the
                     beach at Niu Barae, the earthquake has revealed
                     a sunken vessel that locals believe is a Japanese
                     patrol boat, a remnant of the fierce fighting
                     between Allied forces and the Japanese in

                       for stronger protections for the overfished
                       bluefin tuna, an increasingly rare delicacy
                       in high-end restaurants around the world.
                       EU Fisheries Commissioner Joe Borg said he
                       wants to extend the fishing offseason, reduce
                       tuna sold on the black market, and impose

                         in Golfo de Santa Clara say their catches
                         of shrimp and fish have steadily declined
                         over the years. GOLFO DE SANTA CLARA, Mexico
                         - ...The Mexican government set up a reserve
                         in 1993 to protect the vaquita porpoises,
                         which become entangled in fishing nets and
                         drown. But the area is too small, with fishing
                         banned in only about 637 square miles. Environmentalists
                         from the United States and Mexico had begged
                         the fishermen to stop using the gill nets
                         that are killing off La Vaquita, or the
                         little cow, a porpoise that now has the
                         dubious distinction of being one of the
                         most endangered marine mammals in the world.
                         Only about 400 of them survive in the waters
                         at the tip of the Gulf of California where
                         the Colorado River once poured into the sea,
                         environmentalists say, and the only way to
                         save them is to ban commercial fishing with
                         nets in about 1,545 square miles.... Environmentalists
                         have put forward proposals to pay the fishermen
                         not to fish and to develop tourism as an alternative
                         source of income. But the men with rope-hardened
                         hands and weathered faces are skeptical. ..."They
                         want us to stop fishing," said Andres
                         Gonzalez, a 43-year-old fisherman. "They
                         want to take care of the animals here, but
                         they are not taking care of the people." ...biologists
                         say studies of the carcasses of the vaquita
                         porpoises show no signs of malnourishment,
                         but plenty of scars from fishing nets. The
                         advocates of buying out the fishermen note
                         that the human population at the gulf's tip
                         is quite small, about 50,000 people in three
                         towns, including maybe 10,000 fishermen. The
                         solution, they say, is to ban fishing with
                         nets in the upper gulf and establish a $50
                         million trust fund and use the earnings to
                         pay fishermen a total of about $4 million
                         a year, not to fish but to pursue other trades.
                         The program would last at least seven years,
                        until the porpoise population could recover....</span>

                 Million Years and a Farewell</a>. By ANDREW
                 C. REVKIN, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   The first species to be erased from this
                   planet's great and ancient Order of Cetaceans
                   in modern times is not one of the charismatic
                   sea mammals that have long been the focus
                   of conservation campaigns, like the sperm
                   whale or bottlenose dolphin. It appears
                   to be the baiji, a white, nearly blind denizen
                   of the Yangtze River in China. On Wednesday,
                   an expedition in search of any baiji, run
                   by Chinese biologists and baiji.org, a Swiss
                   foundation, ended empty-handed after six
                   weeks of patrolling its onetime waters in
                   the middle and lower stretches of the river,
                   the baiji's only known habitat. The Yangtze,
                   Asia's longest waterway and thought to be
                   akin to the Amazon long ago in its biological
                   richness, now has a dominant species: the
                   400 million (and counting) people busily
                   plying its waters and industrializing its
                   banks. For some 20 million years, the baiji,
                   also called the white-flag dolphin, frequented
                   the Yangtze's sandy shallows, using sonar
                   to catch fish in the silty flow. In the
                   last few decades, the dolphin's numbers
                   plunged as rapidly as the Chinese economy
                   surged. The Yangtze's sandy shallows, which
                   the baiji frequented, have largely been
                   dredged for shipping. The baiji sought fish
                   that have been netted or driven from the
                   river by pollution. And its sonar may have
                   been disrupted by the propeller noise from
                   boats above. A 1997 survey counted 13 baiji
                   in the river. None of the dolphins survive
                   in captivity...... </span>

                   Sees 'Global Collapse' of Fish Species</a>.
                   By CORNELIA DEAN, NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     If fishing around the world continues at
                     its present pace, more and more species
                     will vanish, marine ecosystems will unravel
                     and there will be "global collapse" of
                     all species currently fished, possibly as
                     soon as midcentury, fisheries experts and
                     ecologists are predicting. The scientists,
                     who report their findings today in the journal
                     Science, say it is not too late to turn
                     the situation around. As long as marine
                     ecosystems are still biologically diverse,
                     they can recover quickly once overfishing
                     and other threats are reduced, the researchers
                     say. But improvements must come quickly,
                     said Boris Worm of Dalhousie University
                     in Nova Scotia, who led the work. Otherwise,
                     he said, "we are seeing the bottom
                     of the barrel." ...Twelve scientists
                     from the United States, Canada, Sweden and
                     Panama contributed to the work reported
                     in Science today. "We extracted all
                     data on fish and invertebrate catches from
                     1950 to 2003 within all 64 large marine
                     ecosystems worldwide," they wrote. "Collectively,
                     these areas produced 83 percent of global
                     fisheries yields over the past 50 years." ...The
                     researchers found that 29 percent of species
                     had been fished so heavily or were so affected
                     by pollution or habitat loss that they were
                     down to 10 percent of previous levels, their
                     definition of "collapse." ...Dr.
                     Worm said ... he...extrapolated the data
                     into the future "to see where it ends
                     at 100 percent collapse, you arrive at 2048."....</span>

                       GENEVA, Switzerland, Environment News Service
                       (ENS) - Survival strategies for coral reefs
                       and mangroves threatened by climate change
                       are outlined by scientists of IUCN-World
                       Conservation Union and the Nature Conservancy
                       in two new publications launched today.
                       The strategies rely on managing stressors
                       other than global warming so that corals
                       and mangroves are more resilient and able
                       to survive in a warming world. Climate change
                       is destroying tropical marine ecosystems
                       through sea temperature increase and ocean
                       acidification. Scientists say 20 percent
                       of the world's coral reefs have already
                       been ruined and a further 50 percent are
                       facing immediate or long term danger of
                       collapse. Yet, one of the reports published
                       today shows that saving the world's coral
                       reefs may still be possible. By fighting
                       other stress factors such as pollution or
                       overfishing impacting coral reefs, the reefs
                       will be able to better adapt to climate
                       change impacts, according to the report, "Coral
                       Reef Resilience and Resistance to Bleaching." ...Coral
                       reefs only cover 0.2 percent of the ocean
                       floor, but contain 25 percent of marine
                       species globally. Coral reefs provide livelihoods
                       to 100 million people and provide the basis
                       for industries such as tourism and fishing,
                       worth an annual net benefit of US$30 billion,
                       the report states. One hectare of mangroves
                       is estimated to deliver products and services
                       worth up to $900,000. Examples of these
                       products and services include timber and
                       wood chips, an environment for fish spawning,
                       and habitat for economically important species.

                 Biologist and the Sea: Lessons in Marine-Life
                 Restoration</a>. By ANDREW C. REVKIN. <span>Excerpt:
                   MONTAUK, N.Y. - For Carl Safina - a biologist,
                   conservationist and prize-winning author
                   - passions and intellectual pursuits are
                   deeply entwined. Dr. Safina's doctoral thesis
                   was on the interrelated behaviors and annual
                   rhythms of the common tern and bluefish,
                   which feast on the same bay anchovies and
                   other small prey. On a recent three-hour
                   fishing trip Dr. Safina reflected on two
                   decades of work revealing the enormous disruption
                   of ocean ecosystems by industrial-scale
                   fishing and other human activities.  His
                   prime goal, he has said, is to develop a "sea
                   ethic" similar to the land ethic of
                   Aldo Leopold, and a scattering of success
                   stories has convinced him that a balance
                   is still possible between exploitation and
                   conservation of marine resources.<br />
                   Dr. Safina: In general, I'm O.K. with using
                   what's in the oceans. I just don't think
                   we should be using it up. So the point to
                   me is not necessarily to put things off
                   limits, although some places probably should
                   be off limits where fish spawn and places
                   like that. But the main thing is to restore
                   the abundance of what's in the ocean so
                   that we can have a viable system where all
                   these animals can live and eat each other,
                   and then we can take a little bit.<br />
                   Q. What most discourages you related to
                   the trends you see in the oceans?<br />
                   A. That it's so easy to see what we need
                   to do, it's so easy to see how things can
                   be so much better and yet it's taking so
                   much time to come around to it.<br />
                   Q. What are some of those improvements?<br />
                   A. We need to just set fishing quotas and
                   adhere to them, and make them realistic,
                   and listen to what the scientists say about
                   how many fish can come out of the ocean.
                   And if we do that, we will get more of what
                   we want.<br />
                   Q. And what's one of the most encouraging
                   things you've seen?<br />
                   A. That fish are recoverable. Many of the
                   fish that we have here were much less abundant
                   15 years ago than they are now. We did get
                   some good regulations passed, and the fish
                   began recovering right away. They know what
                   to do. If you just don't kill them as fast,
                   they start coming back. So the most encouraging
                   thing is that it works, but a lot of that
                   could be much more widespread throughout
                   the country and the rest of the world.</span>

                   a Seven-Year Ban, Salmon Fishing Returns
                   to Maine</a>. By PAM BELLUCK, The New York
                   Times. <span>Excerpt:
                     EDDINGTON, Me. - Forget your trout, your
                     striped bass. Wild Atlantic salmon are a
                     fisherman's Holy Grail. For the first time
                     since 1999, Maine salmon fishermen wait
                     to try their luck in the Eddington Pool
                     below the Veazie Dam on the Penobscot River.
                     ... in 1999, Maine, the last American bastion
                     of wild Atlantic salmon, closed its rivers
                     to salmon fishing to save the salmon, whose
                     numbers had shrunk from pollution, dams
                     and other forces. ...Now, with salmon slowly
                     returning, Maine has opened its first wild
                     salmon season in seven years - a month of
                     restricted fishing on the state's storied
                     Penobscot River. ...Maine is starting with
                     baby steps: fall fishing, when salmon are
                     smaller; catch-and-release only; no barbs
                     on fishhooks; and no fishing when the water
                     temperature hits 70 degrees because hooked
                     fish recover better in cooler water. Mr.
                     Keliher said each salmon reaching the Veazie
                     Dam, where they are temporarily trapped,
                     will be checked to see if it was hooked
                     and what condition it is in. If the fish
                     seem to withstand the fall season, Maine
                     may allow the more-popular spring fishing.
                     The restrictions satisfied most environmentalists,
                     said Andrew Goode, board president of the
                     Penobscot River Restoration Project, the

                         Partners Create Plan to Save Ocean Habitat
                         Along With Fishing</a> <br />

                           MORRO BAY, Calif. - Fishery closings are generally
                           not greeted as good news in ports like this.<br />
                           Angry protests are more likely. So to find
                           an environmentalist and two commercial fishermen
                           quietly conspiring on the bridge of a fishing
                           boat docked in Morro Bay as a far-reaching
                           prohibition on bottom trawling went into
                           effect on the West Coast this summer was
                           unusual, to say the least.<br />
                           The environmentalist, Chuck Cook, said he
                           had been called a "conservation Nazi" in
                           some ports. And Gordon Fox, who has been
                           dragging fish and shrimp from the bottom
                           of the Pacific Ocean for nearly 30 years,
                           admitted the conversation would be "perceived
                           by some in the industry to be sleeping with
                           the enemy." Together with other fishermen
                           and conservationists, Mr. Cook and Mr. Fox
                           have fashioned a plan that they hope will
                           preserve the fish and, just as important
                           to both of them, fishing here off the central
                           coast of California. It is a complicated
                           deal centered on a simple quid pro quo,
                           Mr. Cook said. The trawlers in Morro Bay
                           agreed to join the Nature Conservancy and
                           Environmental Defense, an organization that
                           advocates market-based solutions, in proposing
                           three "no-trawl zones." They would
                           cover nearly 6,000 square miles of ocean
                           between here and Monterey Bay, an area roughly
                           the size of Connecticut. In exchange, the
                           Nature Conservancy agreed to buy fishing
                           permits and boats from fishermen, like Mr.
                           Fox, who want to get out of the trawling
                           business, trade their boats for smaller
                           vessels, and try to find more selective,
                           sustainable ways to continue fishing. ...The
                           deal struck by conservationists and fishermen
                           follows a chart laid out by the National
                           Research Council in a 2002 report on the
                           devastating effect of repeatedly dragging
                           nets across seafloor habitat. "That's
                           been our bible on this project," Mr.
                           Cook said of his well-worn copy of the study,
                           which surveyed years of research on trawling.
                           Its recommendations included closing vulnerable
                           areas of the ocean floor to bottom trawling
                           and reducing fishing outside protected areas
                           in tandem, rather than as separate strategies,
                          as had been done in the past.</span></p>

                 Depletes Mediterranean Tuna, Conservationists
                 Say</a>. By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL. NY Times. <span>Excerpt:
                   SUCURAJ, Croatia - Two decades ago, the
                   channels that separate the Adriatic Islands
                   here were brimming with giant bluefin tuna,
                   a species so plentiful that tourists used
                   to climb ladders by the sea to watch the
                   schools swim by.<br />
                   Today, these majestic predators are rarely
                   if ever caught. ...The tuna population in
                   the Mediterranean is nearing extinction,
                   a new World Wildlife Fund report concludes,
                   with catches down 80 percent over the past
                   few years, even for high-tech trawlers that
                   now comb remote corners of the sea in search
                   of the hard-to-find fish. ..."Significant
                   negative changes" have occurred in
                   the fish stocks of the Adriatic because
                   of overfishing, said Dr. Nedo Vrgoc of the
                   Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries
                   in Split, Croatia, with a particularly steep
                   reduction in long-lived fish species like
                   rays, John Dory and anglerfish....</span>

                 of Coral Reefs Could Be Destroyed</a>. <span>Nearly
                   half of the world's coral reefs may be lost
                   in the next 40 years unless urgent measures
                   are taken to protect them against the threat
                   of climate change, according to a new report
                   released Tuesday by the World Conservation
                   Union. The Swiss-based organization called
                   for the establishment of additional marine
                   protected areas to prevent further degradation
                   by making corals more robust and helping them
                   resist bleaching...Coral bleaching is caused
                   by increased surface temperatures in the high
                   seas and higher levels of sunlight caused
                   by climate change. As temperatures rise, the
                   algae on which corals depend for food and
                   color die out, causing the coral to whiten,

                 the Imperiled Bluefin From Ocean to Sushi
                 Platter.</a> By ANDREW C. REVKIN. NY Times. <span>For
                   sushi aficionados, the essence of the Atlantic
                   bluefin tuna is its fat-laced, butter-soft
                   belly meat, called toro. For the long-liners,
                   purse seiners, harpooners, trappers and fish
                   farmers who seek the bluefin from Cape Hatteras
                   to the frigid waters south of Iceland to the
                   balmy Mediterranean, the fish are a potential
                   bonanza, with choice specimens fetching $50,000
                   or more in Tokyo. But the intensifying trade
                   in bluefin may soon empty the waters of this
                   master of the sea. In just the last 35 years,
                   exploding markets for sushi-grade tuna, combined
                   with intensifying industrial-scale hunts aided
                   by satellites and spotters in airplanes, have
                   devastated not only the fish but also many
                   fisheries. ...The threat to the bluefin was
                   underscored last week by researchers who have
                   tracked hundreds of the fish on their ocean-spanning
                   journeys using electronic tags. They found
                   that the tuna that spawn in the west, which
                   are most severely depleted, are further threatened
                   by an ever-broadening gantlet of hooks, seines,
                   harpoons, traps and now farm-style pens, in
                   which netted fish are raised and fattened
                   - all to supply the Japanese sushi trade.
                   Dr. Barbara A. Block, a marine biologist at
                   Stanford and the lead author of a study, published
                   in the April 28 issue of Nature, said she
                   found it hard to believe that "a fish
                   of this size and beauty, an animal that had
                   captured the hearts of fishermen and scientists
                   alike for millennia, is slipping off Earth." ...Adult
                   bluefins, some topping half a ton and living
                   40 years, slice through icy or tropical waters
                   .... ...In the paper, Dr. Block and her colleagues
                   recommended seasonal bans on long-line fishing
                   in spawning hot spots in the gulf. They also
                   urged tighter controls on fishing in the Central
                   Atlantic, where a feeding area straddles the
                   existing boundary line and fish from both
                   coasts congregate. Right now, that area is
                   intensively fished by a host of countries
                   with almost no monitoring. Without action,
                   Dr. Block said, the western population has
                   little hope. "If such megafauna can disappear,
                   imagine what else is occurring?" she
                   said. "And it's all because we do not
                   have a system that manages the oceans properly." American
                   boat owners say that existing restrictions
                   on long-line fishing in the Gulf are sufficient,
                   and add that the spawning zones identified
                   by Dr. Block are likely to shift each year,
                   making specific "time-area closures" 
                   impossible. Long-liners in the area also use
                   lightweight hooks that hold smaller yellowfin
                   but are designed to uncoil under the powerful
                   tug of a bluefin, they say. Dr. Block said
                   that when she worked on long-line vessels
                   in the region, the same smaller hooks caught
                   and killed a substantial number of bluefin.
                   She added that only a few percent of longliners
                   in the area carry observers who independently
                   tally bluefin deaths. Perhaps the biggest
                   unresolved question is whether the new information
                   can change an international regulatory regime
                   that almost everyone, from anglers and commercial
                   fishers to biologists and tuna diplomats,
                   agrees is broken. There are signs that the
                   accumulated scientific evidence is starting
                   to sway some members of the International
                   Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
                   Tunas, the body created under a treaty in
                   1969 to oversee the fishery. ...In an interview
                   last week, Masanori Miyahara, the chairman
                   of the commission and a senior fisheries official
                   from Japan, acknowledged that the existing
                   system had failed. ..."We feel some responsibility
                   for this mess," he said. "Japanese
                   buyers are running all around the world and
                   buying as many fish as possible, particularly
                   bluefin. </span>

                   Plastic Sea. by Kristi Coale, Terrain Magazine</a>. <span>Swirling
                     in the Central and North Pacific Ocean is
                     a mass of debris the size of Africa. Scientists
                     have dubbed this mass, over which no country
                     has authority or responsibility, the "Synthetic
                     Sea." Why? Because it is filled with
                     floating plastic waste. Between 1999 and 2002,
                     Captain Charles Moore and researchers with
                     the Algalita Marine Research Foundation made
                     several trips to the Pacific Ocean halfway
                     between San Francisco and Hawai'i to study
                     the situation. What he has found is startling.
                     Dragging trawlers behind his ship, Moore and
                     his researchers took samples to assess the
                     effects of the plastic on sea life. They compared
                     the mass of zooplankton to the mass of plastic
                     and found that for every pound of zooplankton,
                     there were six pounds of plastic....Plastics
                     in the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean
                     trap, sicken, and otherwise disable an average
                     of 25 sea lions, harbor seals, and other mammals
                     locally each year, says Jennifer Witherspoon,
                     formerly with the Marine Mammal Center. "Some
                     get tangled in discarded fishing nets and
                     packing strap, and we do save some," she
                     explains. "We autopsy those who die,
                     and we've found plastics and, in one instance,
                     a sock." Externally, they can maim wildlife.
                     Witherspoon recalls "Michelin," 
                     a sea lion found with a rubber tube around
                     his neck; researchers had to euthanize him.
                     An elephant seal with packing strap around
                     her middle was lucky. 
                     "We cut the strap, and she doubled in
                     size," 
                     says Witherspoon. "She hadn't been able
                     to take a breath in some time." ...Sea-dwelling
                     birds and other species do not distinguish
                     between food and small pieces of plastic.
                     That's because many of the plastic pieces
                     are small and tan, resembling krill. Resin
                     beads, or nurdles, resemble fish eggs. Birds
                     and other animals ingest these particles,
                     which make them feel sated, robbing them of
                     the drive to find real food and depriving
                     them of nutrients. Some birds, such as the
                     albatross, regurgitate this polymer-laced
                     meal to feed their chicks. Researchers have
                     found shampoo bottle caps and electric wire
                     plugs in the remains of albatross chicks.

                 For Black Gold. Can California sturgeon farms
                 help preserve a species half a world away?</a> by
                 Carol Hunter. Terrain Magazine pp. 22-27. <span>Ken
                   Beer has a farm in the Central Valley, just
                   about 20 miles south of Sacramento. ... while
                   his neighbors raise dairy cattle, alfalfa
                   and winter wheat, Beer's farm is filled with
                   row upon row of white, circular tanks that
                   hold about one million pounds of California
                   white sturgeon.... inside the belly of each
                   mature female Beer hopes he'll find the black
                   gold of the sea: caviar. For connoisseurs
                   and gourmets, choices about caviar are usually
                   pretty simple. Beluga or osetra? One ounce
                   or two? But now, people like Ken Beer are
                   allowing consumers to face a more profound
                   choice: wild or farm-raised? Caviar has long
                   been equated with luxury, the food of kings
                   and czars. But while the sturgeons that produce
                   caviar were once abundant in the oceans, lakes,
                   and seas of the northern hemisphere, they
                   have been fished to dangerously low levels
                   around the world. In North America, five of
                   the nine species of sturgeon and closely related
                   paddlefish are federally listed as endangered,
                   while in the Caspian Sea, which historically
                   has been home to the world's largest abundance
                   of sturgeon, annual catches have dropped by
                   95 percent in the last hundred years, from
                   over 20,000 tons in the early 1900s to only
                   1000 tons in the late 1990s. While many government
                   and international agencies have tried to regulate
                   sturgeon fisheries, the high price of caviar,
                   which can sell for well over $100 an ounce,
                   continues to draw poachers and black market
                   smugglers into an illegal trade....Ken Beer
                   wasn't thinking of saving threatened species
                   when he started studying sturgeon aquaculture
                   25 years ago. He had been raising catfish
                   for about three years and was thinking of
                   ways to make his farm more efficient. ...Because
                   sturgeon farming uses a land-based facility
                   with fresh water, it avoids many of the harmful
                   environmental effects of other aquaculture,
                   like open-water salmon farming. There are
                   no escapes and mixing of gene pools, no contamination
                   of wild species with diseases or parasites,
                   and no flow of wastes directly into any open
                   water resource. </span> </p>

                 the Seas Warm, Algae Help Some Coral Stand
                 Up to the Heat.</a> NY Times- By CORNELIA
                 DEAN . <span>KEY LARGO,
                   Fla. - For some time, scientists have predicted
                   that the world's coral reefs will be among
                   the first ecosystems to suffer devastating
                   damage from global warming. Some reefs, however,
                   are proving surprisingly resilient, researchers
                   say, not because of qualities of the corals
                   themselves, but because of heat-tolerant algae
                   that live with them. It may even be possible
                   that heat-related episodes of coral bleaching,
                   which had been viewed as ominous previews
                   of mass coral death to come, could allow these
                   robust algae to spread, leaving corals better
                   able to survive in a warmer world. The scientists
                   say this strength in the face of warming will
                   not be enough to save the world's coral reefs,
                   which are threatened by pollution, overfishing,
                   tourism and other human activities. But if
                   the findings hold up, "they essentially
                   buy us time" to address those issues,
                   said Dr. Andrew C. Baker of the Marine Program
                   of the Wildlife Conservation Society, who
                   led the new work. </span>

                         of conservation and animal welfare groups yesterday
                         threatened to take formal action against the

                         measures to mitigate harm to marine mammals
                         and fish caused by the Navy's use of mid-frequency,
                         high intensity active sonar. The coalition includes
